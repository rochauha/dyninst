DyninstAPI
==========

This section describes functions in the API. The API is organized as a
collection of C++ classes. The primary classes are BPatch,
Bpatch_process, BPatch_binaryEdit, BPatch_thread, BPatch_image,
BPatch_point, and BPatch_snippet. The API also uses a template class
called std::vector. This class is based on the Standard Template Library
(STL) vector class.

``BPatch``
----------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch

.. cpp:class:: BPatch
   
   The ``BPatch`` class represents the entire Dyninst library. There can
   only be one instance of this class at a time. This class is used to
   perform functions and obtain information that is not specific to a
   particular thread or image.
   
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_process*> *getProcesses()
      
      Returns the list of processes that are currently defined. This list
      includes processes that were directly created by calling
      processCreate/processAttach, and indirectly by the UNIX fork or the
      Windows CreateProcess system call. It is up to the user to delete this
      vector when they are done with it.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_process *processAttach(const char *path, int pid, \
                        BPatch_hybridMode mode=BPatch_normalMode)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_process *processCreate(const char *path, const char *argv[], \
                        const char **envp = NULL, int stdin_fd=0, int stdout_fd=1, int \
                        stderr_fd=2, BPatch_hybridMode mode=BPatch_normalMode)
      
      Each of these functions returns a pointer to a new instance of the
      BPatch_process class. The path parameter needed by these functions
      should be the pathname of the executable file containing the process
      image. The processAttach function returns a BPatch_process associated
      with an existing process. On Linux platforms the path parameter can be
      NULL since the executable image can be derived from the process pid.
      Attaching to a process puts it into the stopped state. The processCreate
      function creates a new process and returns a new BPatch_process
      associated with it. The new process is put into a stopped state before
      executing any code.
      
      The stdin_fd, stdout_fd, and stderr_fd parameters are used to set the
      standard input, output, and error of the child process. The default
      values of these parameters leave the input, output, and error to be the
      same as the mutator process. To change these values, an open UNIX file
      descriptor (see open(1)) can be passed.
      
      The mode parameter is used to select the desired level of code analysis.
      Activating hybrid code analysis causes Dyninst to augment its static
      analysis of the code with run-time code discovery techniques. There are
      three modes: BPatch_normalMode, BPatch_exploratoryMode, and
      BPatch_defensiveMode. Normal mode enables the regular static analysis
      features of Dyninst. Exploratory mode and defensive mode enable
      addtional dynamic features to correctly analyze programs that contain
      uncommon code patterns, such as malware. Exploratory mode is primarily
      oriented towards analyzing dynamic control transfers, while defensive
      mode additionally aims to tackle code obfuscation and self-modifying
      code. Both of these modes are still experimental and should be used with
      caution. Defensive mode is only supported on Windows.
      
      Defensive mode has been tested on normal binaries (binaries that run
      correctly under normal mode), as well as some simple, packed executables
      (self-decrypting or decompressing). More advanced forms of code
      obfuscation, such as self-modifying code, have not been tested recently.
      The traditional Dyninst interface may be used for instrumentation of
      binaries in defensive mode, but in the case of highly obfuscated code,
      this interface may prove to be ineffective due to the lack of a complete
      view of control flow at any given point. Therefore, defensive mode also
      includes a set of callbacks that enables instrumentation to be performed
      as new code is discovered. Due to the fact that recent efforts have
      focused on simpler forms of obfuscation, these callbacks have not been
      tested in detail. The next release of Dyninst will target more advanced
      uses of defensive mode.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_binaryEdit *openBinary(const char *path, bool openDependencies = false)
      
      This function opens the executable file or library file pointed to by
      path for binary rewriting. If openDependencies is true then Dyninst will
      also open all shared libraries that path depends on. Upon success, this
      function returns a new instance of a BPatch_binaryEdit class that
      represents the opened file and any dependent shared libraries. This
      function returns NULL in the event of an error.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool pollForStatusChange()
      
      This is useful for a mutator that needs to periodically check on the
      status of its managed threads and does not want to check each process
      individually. It returns true if there has been a change in the status
      of one or more threads that has not yet been reported by either
      isStopped or isTerminated.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void setDebugParsing (bool state)
      
      Turn on or off the parsing of debugger information. By default, the
      debugger information (produced by the â€“g compiler option) is parsed on
      those platforms that support it. However, for some applications this
      information can be quite large. To disable parsing this information,
      call this method with a value of false prior to creating a process.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool parseDebugInfo()
      
      Return true if debugger information parsing is enabled, or false otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void setTrampRecursive (bool state)
      
      Turn on or off trampoline recursion.
      
      By default, any snippets invoked
      while another snippet is active will not be executed. This is the safest
      behavior, since recursively-calling snippets can cause a program to take
      up all available system resources and die. For example, adding
      instrumentation code to the start of printf, and then calling printf
      from that snippet will result in infinite recursion.
      
      This protection operates at the granularity of an instrumentation point.
      When snippets are first inserted at a point, this flag determines
      whether code will be created with recursion protection. Changing the
      flag is **not** retroactive, and inserting more snippets will not change
      the recursion protection of the point. Recursion protection increases
      the overhead of instrumentation points, so if there is no way for the
      snippets to call themselves, calling this method with the parameter true
      will result in a performance gain. The default value of this flag is
      false.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isTrampRecursive ()
      
      Return whether trampoline recursion is enabled or not. True means that it is enabled.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void setTypeChecking(bool state)
      
      Turn on or off type-checking of snippets.
      
      By default type-checking is
      turned on, and an attempt to create a snippet that contains type
      conflicts will fail. Any snippet expressions created with type-checking
      off have the type of their left operand. Turning type-checking off,
      creating a snippet, and then turning type-checking back on is similar to
      the type cast operation in the C programming language.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isTypeChecked()
      
      Return true if type-checking of snippets is enabled, or false otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool waitForStatusChange()
      
      This function waits until there is a status change to some thread that
      has not yet been reported by either isStopped or isTerminated, and then
      returns true. It is more efficient to call this function than to call
      pollForStatusChange in a loop, because waitForStatusChange blocks the
      mutator process while waiting.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void setDelayedParsing (bool)
      
      Turn on or off delayed parsing. When it is activated Dyninst will
      initially parse only the symbol table information in any new modules
      loaded by the program, and will postpone more thorough analysis
      (instrumentation point analysis, variable analysis, and discovery of new
      functions in stripped binaries). This analysis will automatically occur
      when the information is necessary.
      
      Users which require small run-time perturbation of a program should not
      delay parsing; the overhead for analysis may occur at unexpected times
      if it is triggered by internal Dyninst behavior. Users who desire
      instrumentation of a small number of functions will benefit from delayed
      parsing.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool delayedParsingOn()
      
      Return true if delayed parsing is enabled, or false otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void setInstrStackFrames(bool)
      
      Turn on and off stack frames in instrumentation.
      
      When on, Dyninst will
      create stack frames around instrumentation. A stack frame allows Dyninst
      or other tools to walk a call stack through instrumentation, but
      introduces overhead to instrumentation. The default is to not create
      stack frames.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getInstrStackFrames()
      
      Return true if instrumentation will create stack frames, or false otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void setMergeTramp (bool)
      
      Turn on or off inlined tramps. Setting this value to true will make each
      base trampoline have all of its mini-trampolines inlined within it.
      Using inlined mini-tramps may allow instrumentation to execute faster,
      but inserting and removing instrumentation may take more time. The
      default setting for this is true.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isMergeTramp ()
      
      This returns the current status of inlined trampolines. A value of true
      indicates that trampolines are inlined.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void setSaveFPR (bool)
      
      Turn on or off floating point saves. Setting this value to false means
      that floating point registers will never be saved, which can lead to
      large performance improvements. The default value is true. Setting this
      flag may cause incorrect program behavior if the instrumentation does
      clobber floating point registers, so it should only be used when the
      user is positive this will never happen.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isSaveFPROn ()
      
      This returns the current status of the floating point saves. True means
      we are saving floating points based on the analysis for the given
      platform.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void setBaseTrampDeletion(bool)
      
      If true, we delete the base tramp when the last corresponding minitramp
      is deleted. If false, we leave the base tramp in. The default value is
      false.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool baseTrampDeletion()
      
      Return true if base trampolines are set to be deleted, or false
      otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void setLivenessAnalysis(bool)
      
      If true, we perform register liveness analysis around an instPoint
      before inserting instrumentation, and we only save registers that are
      live at that point. This can lead to faster run-time speeds, but at the
      expense of slower instrumentation time. The default value is true.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool livenessAnalysisOn()
      
      Return true if liveness analysis is currently enabled.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getBPatchVersion(int &major, int &minor, int &subminor)
      
      Return Dyninstâ€™s version number. The major version number will be stored
      in major, the minor version number in minor, and the subminor version in
      subminor. For example, under Dyninst 5.1.0, this function will return 5
      in major, 1 in minor, and 0 in subminor.
      
   .. cpp:function:: int getNotificationFD()
      
      Returns a file descriptor that is suitable for inclusion in a callÂ to
      select(). Dyninst will write data to this file descriptor when it to
      signal a state change in the process. BPatch::pollForStatusChange should
      then be called so that Dyninst can handle the state change. This is
      useful for applications where the user does not want to block in
      BPatch::waitForStatusChange. The file descriptor will reset when the
      user calls BPatch::pollForStatusChange.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_type *createArray(const char *name, BPatch_type *ptr, unsigned int low, unsigned int hi)
      
      Create a new array type. The name of the type is name, and the type of
      each element is ptr. The index of the first element of the array is low,
      and the last is high. The standard rules of type compatibility,
      described in Section 4.28, are used with arrays created using this
      function.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_type *createEnum(const char *name, std::vector<char *> &elementNames, \
                        std::vector<int> &elementIds)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_type *createEnum(const char *name, std::vector<char *> &elementNames)
      
      Create a new enumerated type. There are two variations of this function.
      The first one is used to create an enumerated type where the user
      specifies the identifier (int) for each element. In the second form, the
      system specifies the identifiers for each element. In both cases, a
      vector of character arrays is passed to supply the names of the elements
      of the enumerated type. In the first form of the function, the number of
      element in the elementNames and elementIds vectors must be the same, or
      the type will not be created and this function will return NULL. The
      standard rules of type compatibility, described in Section 4.28, are
      used with enums created using this function.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_type *createScalar(const char *name, int size)
      
      Create a new scalar type. The name field is used to specify the name of
      the type, and the size parameter is used to specify the size in bytes of
      each instance of the type. No additional information about this type is
      supplied. The type is compatible with other scalars with the same name
      and size.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_type *createStruct(const char *name, std::vector<char *> &fieldNames, \
                        std::vector<BPatch_type *> &fieldTypes)
      
      Create a new structure type. The name of the structure is specified in
      the name parameter. The fieldNames and fieldTypes vectors specify fields
      of the type. These two vectors must have the same number of elements or
      the function will fail (and return NULL). The standard rules of type
      compatibility, described in Section 4.28, are used with structures
      created using this function. The size of the structure is the sum of the
      size of the elements in the fieldTypes vector.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_type *createTypedef(const char *name, BPatch_type *ptr)
      
      Create a new type called name and having the type ptr.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_type *createPointer(const char *name, BPatch_type *ptr)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_type *createPointer(const char *name, BPatch_type *ptr, int size)
      
      Create a new type, named name, which points to objects of type ptr. The
      first form creates a pointer whose size is equal to sizeof(void*)on the
      target platform where the mutaÂ­tee is running. In the second form, the
      size of the pointer is the value passed in the size parameter.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_type *createUnion(const char *name, std::vector<char *>&fieldNames, \
                        std::vector<BPatch_type *> &fieldTypes)
      
      Create a new union type. The name of the union is specified in the name
      parameter. The fieldNames and fieldTypes vectors specify fields of the
      type. These two vectors must have the same number of elements or the
      function will fail (and return NULL). The size of the union is the size
      of the largest element in the fieldTypes vector.
      
``BPatch_addressSpace``
-----------------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_addressSpace

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_addressSpace
   
   The **BPatch_addressSpace** class is a superclass of the BPatch_process
   and BPatch_binaryEdit classes. It contains functionality that is common
   between the two sub classes.
   
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_image *getImage()
      
      Return a handle to the executable file associated with this
      BPatch_process object.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getSourceLines(unsigned long addr, std::vector< BPatch_statement >& lines)
      
      This function returns the line information associated with the mutatee
      address, addr. The vector lines contain pairs of filenames and line
      numbers that are associated with addr. In many cases only one filename
      and line number is associated with an address, but certain compiler
      optimizations may lead to multiple filenames and lines at an address.
      This information is only available if the mutatee was compiled with
      debug information.
      
      This function returns true if it was able to find any line information
      at addr, or false otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getAddressRanges( const char * fileName, unsigned int lineNo, \
                        std::vector< std::pair< unsigned long, unsigned long > > & ranges )
      
      Given a filename and line number, fileName and lineNo, this function
      this function returns the ranges of mutatee addresses that implement the
      code range in the output parameter ranges. In many cases a source code
      line will only have one address range implementing it. However, compiler
      optimizations may transform this into multiple disjoint address ranges.
      This information is only available if the mutatee was compiled with
      debug information.
      
      This function returns true if it was able to find any line information,
      false otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_variableExpr *malloc(int n, std::string name = std::string(""))
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_variableExpr *malloc(const BPatch_type &type, std::string name = std::string(""))
      
      These two functions allocate memory. Memory allocation is from a heap.
      The heap is not necessarily the same heap used by the application. The
      available space in the heap may be limited depending on the
      implementation. The first function, malloc(int n), allocates n bytes of
      memory from the heap. The second function, malloc(const BPatch_type& t),
      allocates enough memory to hold an object of the specified type. Using
      the second version is strongly encouraged because it provides additional
      information to permit better type checking of the passed code. If a name
      is specified, Dyninst will assign var_name to the variable; otherwise,
      it will assign an internal name. The returned memory is persistent and
      will not be released until BPatch_process::free is called or the
      application terminates.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_variableExpr *createVariable(Dyninst::Address addr, \
                        BPatch_type *type, \
                        std::string var_name = std::string(""), \
                        BPatch_module *in_module = NULL)
      
      This method creates a new variable at the given address addr in the
      module in_module. If a name is specified, Dyninst will assign var_name
      to the variable; otherwise, it will assign an internal name. The type
      parameter will become the type for the new variable.
      
      When operating in binary rewriting mode, it is an error for the
      in_module parameter to be NULL; it is necessary to specify the module in
      which the variable will be created. Dyninst will then write the variable
      back out in the file specified by in_module.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool free(BPatch_variableExpr &ptr)
      
      Free the memory in the passed variable ptr. The programmer is
      responsible for verifying that all code that could reference this memory
      will not execute again (either by removing all snippets that refer to
      it, or by analysis of the program). Return true if the free succeeded.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getRegisters(std::vector<BPatch_register> &regs)
      
      This function returns a vector of BPatch_register objects that represent
      registers available to snippet code.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatchSnippetHandle *insertSnippet(const BPatch_snippet &expr, \
         BPatch_point &point, \
         BPatch_callWhen when=BPatch_callBefore| BPatch_callAfter, \
         BPatch_snippetOrder order = BPatch_firstSnippet)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatchSnippetHandle *insertSnippet(const BPatch_snippet &expr, \
         const std::vector<BPatch_point *> &points, \
         BPatch_callWhen when=BPatch_callBefore| BPatch_callAfter, \
         BPatch_snippetOrder order = BPatch_firstSnippet)
      
      Insert a snippet of code at the specified point. If a list of points is
      supplied, insert the code snippet at each point in the list. The
      optional when argument specifies when the snippet is to be called; a
      value of BPatch_callBefore indicates that the snippet should be inserted
      just before the specified point or points in the code, and a value of
      BPatch_callAfter indicates that it should be inserted just after them.
      
      The order argument specifies where the snippet is to be inserted
      relative to any other snippets previously inserted at the same point.
      The values BPatch_firstSnippet and BPatch_lastSnippet indicate that the
      snippet should be inserted before or after all snippets, respectively.
      
      It is illegal to use BPatch_callAfter with a BPatch_entry point. Use
      BPatch_callBefore when instrumenting entry points, which inserts
      instrumentation before the first instruction in a subroutine. Likewise,
      it is illegal to use BPatch_callBefore with a BPatch_exit point. Use
      BPatch_callAfter with exit points. BPatch_callAfter inserts
      instrumentation at the last instruction in the subroutine.
      insertÂ­Snippet will return NULL when used with an illegal pair of
      points.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool deleteSnippet(BPatchSnippetHandle *handle)
      
      Remove the snippet associated with the passed handle. If the handle is
      not defined for the process, then deleteSnippet will return false.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void beginInsertionSet()
      
      Normally, a call to insertSnippet immediately injects instrumentation
      into the mutatee. However, users may wish to insert a set of snippets as
      a single batch operation. This provides two benefits: First, Dyninst may
      insert instrumentation in a more efficient manner. Second, multiple
      snippets may be inserted at multiple points as a single operation, with
      either all snippets being inserted successfully or none. This batch
      insertion mode is begun with a call to beginInsertionSet; after this
      call, no snippets are actually inserted until a corresponding call to
      finalizeInsertionSet. Dyninst accumulates all calls to insertSnippet
      during batch mode internally, and the returned BPatchSnippetHandles are
      filled in when finalizeInsertionSet is called.
      
      Insertion sets are unÂ­necessary when doing static binary
      instrumentation. Dyninst uses an implicit insertion set around all
      instrumentation to a static binary.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool finalizeInsertionSet(bool atomic)
      
      Inserts all snippets accumulated since a call to beginInsertionSet. If
      the atomic parameter is true, then a failure to insert any snippet
      results in all snippets being removed; effectively, the insertion is
      all-or-nothing. If the atomic parameter is false, then snippets are
      inserted individually. This function also fills in the
      BPatchSnippetHandle structures returned by the insertSnippet calls
      comprising this insertion set. It returns true on success and false if
      there was an error inserting any snippets.
      
      Insertion sets are unnecessary when doing static binary instrumentation.
      Dyninst uses an implicit insertion set around all instrumentation to a
      static binary.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool removeFunctionCall(BPatch_point &point)
      
      Disable the mutatee function call at the specified location. The point
      specified must be a valid call point in the image of the mutatee. The
      purpose of this routine is to permit tools to alter the semantics of a
      program by eliminating procedure calls. The mechanism to achieve the
      removal is platform dependent, but might include branching over the call
      or replacing it with NOPs. This function only removes a function call;
      any parameters to the function will still be evaluated.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool replaceFunction (BPatch_function &old, BPatch_function &new)
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool revertReplaceFunction (BPatch_function &old)
      
      Replace all calls to user function old with calls to new. This is done
      by inserting instrumentation (specifically a BPatch_funcJumpExpr) into
      the beginning of function old such that a non-returning jump is made to
      function new. Returns true upon success, false otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool replaceFunctionCall(BPatch_point &point, BPatch_function &newFunc)
      
      Change the function call at the specified point to the function
      indicated by newFunc. The purpose of this routine is to permit runtime
      steering tools to change the behavior of programs by replacing a call to
      one procedure by a call to another. Point must be a function call point.
      If the change was successful, the return value is true, otherwise false
      will be returned.
      
      **WARNING**\ *: Care must be used when replacing functions. In
      particular if the compiler has performed inter-procedural register
      allocation between the original caller/callee pair, the replacement may
      not be safe since the replaced function may clobber registers the
      compiler thought the callee left untouched. Also the signatures of the
      both the function being replaced and the new function must be
      compatible.*
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool wrapFunction(BPatch_function *old, BPatch_function *new, \
         Dyninst::SymtabAPI::Symbol *sym)
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool revertWrapFunction(BPatch_function *old)
      
      Replaces all calls to function old with calls to function new. Unlike
      replaceFunction above, the old function can still be reached via the
      name specified by the provided symbol sym. Function wrapping allows
      existing code to be extended by new code. Consider the following code
      that implements a fast memory allocator for a particular size of memory
      allocation, but falls back to the original memory allocator (referenced
      by origMalloc) for all others.
      
      .. code-block:: cpp
      
         void *origMalloc(unsigned long size);
         
         void *fastMalloc(unsigned long size) {
            if (size == 1024) {
               unsigned long ret = fastPool;
               fastPool += 1024;
               return ret;
            } else {
               return origMalloc(size);
            }
         }
      
      The symbol sym is provided by the user and must exist in the program;
      the easiest way to ensure it is created is to use an undefined function
      as shown above with the definition of origMalloc.
      
      The following code wraps malloc with fastMalloc, while allowing
      functions to still access the original malloc function by calling
      origMalloc. It makes use of the new convert interface described in
      Section 5..
      
      .. code-block:: cpp
      
         using namespace Dyninst;
         
         using namespace SymtabAPI;
         
         BPatch_function *malloc = appImage->findFunction(...);
         
         BPatch_function *fastMalloc = appImage->findFunction(...);
         
         Symtab *symtab = SymtabAPI::convert(fastMalloc->getModule());
         
         std::vector<Symbol *> syms;
         
         symtab->findSymbol(syms, "origMalloc",
         
         Symbol::ST_UNKNOWN, // Donâ€™t specify type
         
         mangledName, // Look for raw symbol name
         
         false, // Not regular expression
         
         false, // Donâ€™t check case
         
         true); // Include undefined symbols
         
         app->wrapFunction(malloc, fastMalloc, syms[0]);
      
      For a full, executable example, see Appendix A - Complete Examples.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool replaceCode(BPatch_point *point, BPatch_snippet *snippet)
      
      This function has been removed; users interested in replacing code
      should instead use the PatchAPI code modification interface described in
      the PatchAPI manual. For information on accessing PatchAPI abstractions
      from DyninstAPI abstractions, see Section 5..
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_module * loadLibrary(const char *libname, bool reload=false)
      
      For dynamic rewriting, this function loads a dynamically linked library
      into the processâ€™s address space. For static rewriting, this function
      adds a library as a library dependency in the rewritten file. In both
      cases Dyninst creates a new BPatch_module to represent this library.
      
      The libname parameter identifies the file name of the library to be
      loaded, in the standard way that dynamically linked libraries are
      specified on the operating system on which the API is running. This
      function returns a handle to the loaded library. The reload parameter is
      ignored and only remains for backwards compatibility.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isStaticExecutable()
      
      This function returns true if the original file opened with this
      BPatch_addressSpace is a statically linked executable, or false
      otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: processType getType()
      
      This function returns a processType that reflects whether this address
      space is a BPatch_process or a BPatch_binaryEdit.
      
``BPatch_process``
------------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_process

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_process
   
   The **BPatch_process** class represents a running process, which
   includes one or more threads of execution and an address space.
   
   .. cpp:function:: bool stopExecution()
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool continueExecution()
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool terminateExecution()
      
      These three functions change the running state of the process.
      stopExecution puts the process into a stopped state. Depending on the
      operating system, stopping one process may stop all threads associated
      with a process. continueExecution continues execution of the process.
      terminateExecution terminates execution of the process and will invoke
      the exit callback if one is registered. Each function returns true on
      success, or false for failure. Stopping or continuing a terminated
      thread will fail and these functions will return false.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isStopped()
      
   .. cpp:function:: int stopSignal()
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isTerminated()
      
      These three functions query the status of a process. isStopped returns
      true if the process is currently stopped. If the process is stopped (as
      indicated by isStopped), then stopSignal can be called to find out what
      signal caused the process to stop. isTerminated returns true if the
      process has exited. Any of these functions may be called multiple times,
      and calling them will not affect the state of the process.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_variableExpr *getInheritedVariable(BPatch_variableExpr &parentVar)
      
      Retrieve a new handle to an existing variable (such as one created by
      BPatch_process::malloc) that was created in a parent process and now
      exists in a forked child process. When a process forks all existing
      BPatch_variableExprs are copied to the child process, but the Dyninst
      handles for these objects are not valid in the child BPatch_process.
      This function is invoked on the child processâ€™ BPatch_process, parentVar
      is a variable from the parent process, and a handle to a variable in the
      child process is returned. If parentVar was not allocated in the parent
      process, then NULL is returned.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatchSnippetHandle *getInheritedSnippet(BPatchSnippetHandle &parentSnippet)
      
      This function is similar to getInheritedVariable, but operates on
      BPatchSnippetHandles. Given a child process that was created via fork
      and a BPatchÂ­SnippetHandle, parentSnippet, from the parent process, this
      function will return a handle to parentSnippet that is valid in the
      child process. If it is determined that parentSnippet is not associated
      with the parent process, then NULL is returned.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void detach(bool cont)
      
      Detach from the process. The process must be stopped to call this
      function. Instrumentation and other changes to the process will remain
      active in the detached copy. The cont parameter is used to indicate if
      the process should be continued as a result of detaching.
      
      Linux does not support detaching from a process while leaving it
      stopped. All processes are continued after detach on Linux.
      
   .. cpp:function:: int getPid()
      
      Return the system id for the mutatee process. On UNIX based systems this
      is a PID. On Windows this is the HANDLE object for a process.
      
   .. cpp:enum:: BPatch_exitType
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_exitType::NoExit
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_exitType::ExitedNormally
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_exitType::ExitedViaSignal
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_exitType terminationStatus()
      
      If the process has exited, terminationStatus will indicate whether the
      process exited normally or because of a signal. If the process has not
      exited, NoExit will be returned. On AIX, the reason why a process exited
      will not be available if the process was not a child of the Dyninst
      mutator; in this case, ExitedNormally will be returned in both normal
      and signal exit cases.
      
   .. cpp:function:: int getExitCode()
      
      If the process exited in a normal way, getExitCode will return the
      associated exit code. Prior to Dyninst 8.2, getExitCode would return the
      argument passed to exit or the value returned by main; in Dyninst 8.2
      and later, it returns the actual exit code as provided by the debug
      interface and seen by the parent process. In particular, on Linux, this
      means that exit codes are normalized to the range 0-255.
      
   .. cpp:function:: int getExitSignal()
      
      If the process exited because of a received signal, getExitSignal will
      return the associated signal number.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void oneTimeCode(const BPatch_snippet &expr)
      
      Cause the snippet expr to be executed by the mutatee immediately. If the
      process is multithreaded, the snippet is run on a thread chosen by
      Dyninst. If the user requires the snippet to be run on a particular
      thread, use the BPatch_thread version of this function instead. The
      process must be stopped to call this function. The behavior is
      synchronous; oneTimeCode will not return until after the snippet has
      been run in the application.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool oneTimeCodeAsync(const BPatch_snippet &expr, void *userData = NULL)
      
      This function sets up a snippet to be evaluated by the process at the
      next available opportunity. When the snippet finishes running Dyninst
      will callback any function registered through
      BPatch::registerOneTimeCodeCallback, with userData passed as a
      parameter. This function return true on success and false if it could
      not post the oneTimeCode.
      
      If the process is multithreaded, the snippet is run on a thread chosen
      by Dyninst. If the user requires the snippet to be run on a particular
      thread, use the BPatch_thread version of this function instead. The
      behavior is asynchronous; oneTimeCodeAsync returns before the snippet is
      executed.
      
      If the process is running when oneTimeCodeAsync is called, expr will be
      run immediately. If the process is stopped, then expr will be run when
      the process is continued.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getThreads(std::vector<BPatch_thread *> &thrds)
      
      Get the list of threads in the process.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isMultithreaded()
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isMultithreadCapable()
      
      The former returns true if the process contains multiple threads; the
      latter returns true if the process can create threads (e.g., it contains
      a threading library) even if it has not yet.
      
``BPatch_thread``
-----------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_thread

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_thread
   
   The **BPatch_thread** class represents and controls a thread of
   execution that is running in a process.
   
   .. cpp:function:: void getCallStack(std::vector<BPatch_frame>& stack)
      
      This function fills the given vector with current information about the
      call stack of the thread. Each stack frame is represented by a
      BPatch_frame (see section 4.24 for information about this class).
      
   .. cpp:function:: dynthread_t getTid()
      
      This function returns a platform-specific identifier for this thread.
      This is the identifier that is used by the threading library. For
      example, on pthread applications this function will return the threadâ€™s
      pthread_t value.
      
   .. cpp:function:: Dyninst::LWP getLWP()
      
      This function returns a platform-specific identifier that the operating
      system uses to identify this thread. For example, on UNIX platforms this
      returns the LWP id. On Windows this returns a HANDLE object for the
      thread.
      
   .. cpp:function:: unsigned getBPatchID()
      
      This function returns a Dyninst-specific identifier for this thread.
      These IDâ€™s apply only to running threads, the BPatch ID of an already
      terminated thread my be repeated in a new thread.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_function *getInitialFunc()
      
      Return the function that was used by the application to start this
      thread. For example, on pthread applications this will return the
      initial function that was passed to pthread_create.
      
   .. cpp:function:: unsigned long getStackTopAddr()
      
      Returns the base address for this threadâ€™s stack.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isDeadOnArrival()
      
      This function returns true if this thread terminated execution before
      Dyninst was able to attach to it. Since Dyninst performs new thread
      detection asynchronously, it is possible for a thread to be created and
      destroyed before Dyninst can attach to it. When this happens, a new
      BPatch_thread is created, but isDeadOnArrival always returns true for
      this thread. It is illegal to perform any thread-level operations on a
      dead on arrival thread.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_process *getProcess()
      
      Return the BPatch_process that contains this thread.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void *oneTimeCode(const BPatch_snippet &expr, bool *err = NULL)
      
      Cause the snippet expr to be evaluated by the process immediately. This
      is similar to the BPatch_process::oneTimeCode function, except that the
      snippet is guaranteed to run only on this thread. The process must be
      stopped to call this function. The behavior is synchronous; oneTimeCode
      will not return until after the snippet has been run in the application.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool oneTimeCodeAsync(const BPatch_snippet &expr, \
         void *userData = NULL, \
         BpatchOneTimeCodeCallback cb = NULL)
      
      This function sets up the snippet expr to be evaluated by this thread at
      the next available opportunity. When the snippet finishes running,
      Dyninst will callback any function registered through
      BPatch::registerOneTimeCodeCallback, with userData passed as a
      parameter. This function returns true if expr was posted or false
      otherwise.
      
      This is similar to the BPatch_process::oneTimeCodeAsync function, except
      that the snippet is guaranteed to run only on this thread. The process
      must be stopped to call this function. The behavior is asynchronous;
      oneTimeCodeAsync returns before the snippet is executed.
      
``BPatch_binaryEdit``
---------------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_binaryEdit

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_binaryEdit
   
   The BPatch_binaryEdit class represents a set of executable files and
   library files for binary rewriting. BPatch_binaryEdit inherits from the
   BPatch_addressSpace class, where most functionality for binary rewriting
   is found.
   
   .. cpp:function:: bool writeFile(const char *outFile)
      
      Rewrite a BPatch_binaryEdit to disk. The original file opened with this
      BPatch_binaryEdit is written to the current working directory with the
      name outFile. If any dependent libraries were also opened and have
      instrumentation or other modifications, then those libraries will be
      written to disk in the current working directory under their original
      names.
      
      A rewritten dependency library should only be used with the original
      file that was opened for rewriting. For example, if the file a.out and
      its dependent library libfoo.so were opened for rewriting, and both had
      instrumentation inserted, then the rewritten libfoo.so should not be
      used without the rewritten a.out. To build a rewritten libfoo.so that
      can load into any process, libfoo.so must be the original file opened by
      BPatch::openBinary.
      
      This function returns true if it successfully wrote a file, or false
      otherwise.
      
``BPatch_sourceObj``
--------------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_sourceObj

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_sourceObj
   
   The BPatch_sourceObj class is the C++ superclass for the
   BPatch_function, BPatch_module, and BPatch_image classes. It provides a
   set of common methods for all three classes. In addition, it can be used
   to build a "generic" source navigator using the getObjParent and
   getSourceObj methods to get parents and children of a given level (i.e.
   the parent of a module is an image, and the children will be the
   functions).
   
   .. cpp:enum:: BPatchErrorLevel
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatchErrorLevel::BPatchFatal
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatchErrorLevel::BPatchSerious
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatchErrorLevel::BPatchWarning
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatchErrorLevel::BPatchInfo
      
   .. cpp:enum:: BPatch_sourceType
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_sourceType::BPatch_sourceUnknown
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_sourceType::BPatch_sourceProgram
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_sourceType::BPatch_sourceModule
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_sourceType::BPatch_sourceFunction
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_sourceType::BPatch_sourceOuterLoop
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_sourceType::BPatch_sourceLoop
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_sourceType::BPatch_sourceStatement
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_sourceType getSrcType()
      
      Returns the type of the current source object.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getSourceObj(std::vector<BPatch_sourceObj *> &objs)
      
      Returns the child source objects of the current source object. For
      example, when called on a BPatch_sourceProgram object this will return
      objects of type BPatch_sourceFunction. When called on a
      BPatch_sourceFunction object it may return BPatch_sourceOuterLoop and
      BPatch_sourceStatement objects.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_sourceObj *getObjParent()
      
      Return the parent source object of the current source object. The parent
      of a BPatch_Â­image is NULL.
      
   .. cpp:enum:: BPatch_language
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_language::BPatch_c
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_language::BPatch_cPlusPlus
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_language::BPatch_fortran
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_language::BPatch_fortran77
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_language::BPatch_fortran90
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_language::BPatch_f90_demangled_stabstr
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_language::BPatch_fortran95
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_language::BPatch_assembly
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_language::BPatch_mixed
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_language::BPatch_hpf
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_language::BPatch_java
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_language::BPatch_unknownLanguage
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_language getLanguage()
      
      Return the source language of the current BPatch_sourceObject. For
      programs that are written in more than one language, BPatch_mixed will
      be returned. If there is insufficient information to determine the
      language, BPatch_unknownLanguage will be returned.
      
``BPatch_function``
-------------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_function

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_function
   
   An object of this class represents a function in the application. A
   BPatch_image object (see description below) can be used to retrieve a
   BPatch_function object representing a given function.
   
   .. cpp:function:: std::string getName();
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::string getDemangledName();
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::string getMangledName();
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::string getTypedName();
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getNames(std::vector<std::string> &names);
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getDemangledNames(std::vector<std::string> &names);
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getMangledNames(std::vector<std::string> &names);
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getTypedNames(std::vector<std::string> &names);
      
      Return name(s) of the function. The getName functions return the primary
      name; this is typically the first symbol we encounter while parsing the
      program; getName is an alias for getDemangledName. The getNames
      functions return all known names for the function, including any names
      specified by weak symbols.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getAddressRange(Dyninst::Address &start, Dyninst::Address &end)
      
      Returns the bounds of the function; for non-contiguous functions, this
      is the lowest and highest address of code that the function includes.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_localVar *> *getParams()
      
      Return a vector of BPatch_localVar snippets that refer to the parameters
      of this function. The position in the vector corresponds to the position
      in the parameter list (starting from zero). The returned local variables
      can be used to check the types of functions, and can be used in snippet
      expressions.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_type *getReturnType()
      
      Return the type of the return value for this function.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_variableExpr *getFunctionRef()
      
      For platforms with complex function pointers (e.g., 64-bit PPC) this
      constructs and returns the appropriate descriptor.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_localVar *> *getVars()
      
      Returns a vector of BPatch_localVar objects that contain the local
      variables in this function. These BPatch_localVars can be used as parts
      of snippets in instrumentation. This function requires debug information
      to be present in the mutatee. If Dyninst was unable to find any local
      variables, this function will return an empty vector. It is up to the
      user to free the vector returned by this function.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isInstrumentable()
      
      Return true if the function can be instrumented, and false if it cannot.
      Various conditions can cause a function to be uninstrumentable. For
      example, there exists a platform-specific minimum function size beyond
      which a function cannot be instrumented.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isSharedLib()
      
      This function returns true if the function is defined in a shared
      library.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_module *getModule()
      
      Return the module that contains this function. Depending on whether the
      program was compiled for debugging or the symbol table stripped, this
      information may not be available. This function returns NULL if module
      information was not found.
      
   .. cpp:function:: char *getModuleName(char *name, int maxLen)
      
      Copies the name of the module that contains this function into the
      buffer pointed to by name. Copies at most maxLen characters and returns
      a pointer to name.

   .. cpp:function:: const std::vector<BPatch_point *> *findPoint(const BPatch_procedureLocation loc)
      
      Return the BPatch_point or list of BPatch_points associated with the
      procedure. It is used to select which type of points associated with the
      procedure will be returned. BPatch_entry and BPatch_exit request
      respectively the entry and exit points of the subroutine.
      BPatch_subroutine returns the list of points where the procedure calls
      other procedures. If the lookup fails to locate any points of the
      requested type, NULL is returned.
      
   .. cpp:enum:: BPatch_opCode
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_opCode::BPatch_opLoad

   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_point *> *findPoint(const std::set<BPatch_opCode>&ops)
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_point *> *findPoint(const BPatch_Set<BPatch_opCode>& ops)
      
      Return the vector of BPatch_points corresponding to the set of machine
      instruction types described by the argument. This version is used
      primarily for memory access instrumentation. The BPatch_opCode is an
      enumeration of instruction types that may be requested: BPatch_opLoad,
      BPatch_opStore, and BPatch_opPrefetch. Any combination of these may be
      requested by passing an appropriate argument set containing the desired
      types. The instrumentation points created by this function have
      additional memory access information attached to them. This allows such
      points to be used for memory access specific snippets (e.g. effective
      address). The memory access information attached is described under
      Memory Access classes in section 4.27.1.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_localVar *findLocalVar(const char *name)
      
      Search the functionâ€™s local variable collection for name. This returns a
      pointer to the local variable if a match is found. This function returns
      NULL if it fails to find any variables.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_variableExpr *> *findVariable(const char * name)
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool findVariable(const char *name, std::vector<BPatch_variableExpr> &vars)
      
      Return a set of variables matching name at the scope of this function.
      If no variables match in the local scope, then the global scope will be
      searched for matches. This function returns NULL if it fails to find any
      variables.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_localVar *findLocalParam(const char *name)
      
      Search the functionâ€™s parameters for a given name. A BPatch_localVar *
      pointer is returned if a match is found, and NULL is returned otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void *getBaseAddr()
      
      Return the starting address of the function in the mutateeâ€™s address
      space.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_flowGraph *getCFG()
      
      Return the control flow graph for the function, or NULL if this
      information is not available. The BPatch_flowGraph is described in
      section 4.16.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool findOverlapping(std::vector<BPatch_function *> &funcs)
      
      Determine which functions overlap with the current function (see Section
      2.). Return true if other functions overlap the current function; the
      overlapping functions are added to the funcs vector. Return false if no
      other functions overlap the current function.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool addMods(std::set<StackMod *> mods)
      
      implemented on x86 and x86-64
      
      Apply stack modifications in mods to the current function; the StackMod
      class is described in section 4.25. Perform error checking, handle stack
      alignment requirements, and generate any modifications required for
      cleanup at function exit. addMods atomically adds all modifications in
      mods; if any mod is found to be unsafe, none of the modifications in
      mods will be applied.
      
      addMods can only be used in binary rewriting mode.
      
      Returns false if the stack modifications are unsafe or if Dyninst is
      unable to perform the analysis required to guarantee safety.
      
``BPatch_point``
----------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_point

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_point
   
   An object of this class represents a location in an applicationâ€™s code
   at which the library can insert instrumentation. A BPatch_image object
   (see section 4.10) is used to retrieve a BPatch_point representing a
   desired point in the application.
   
   .. cpp:enum:: BPatch_procedureLocation
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_procedureLocation::BPatch_entry
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_procedureLocation::BPatch_exit
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_procedureLocation::BPatch_subroutine
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_procedureLocation::BPatch_address
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_procedureLocation getPointType()
      
      Return the type of the point.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_function *getCalledFunction()
      
      Return a BPatch_function representing the function that is called at the
      point. If the point is not a function call site or the target of the
      call cannot be determined, then this function returns NULL.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::string getCalledFunctionName()
      
      Returns the name of the function called at this point. This method is
      similar to getCal-ledFunction()->getName(), except in cases where
      DyninstAPI is running in binary rewritÂ­ing mode and the called function
      resides in a library or object file that DyninstAPI has not opened. In
      these cases, Dyninst is able to determine the name of the called
      function, but is unable to construct a BPatch_function object.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_function *getFunction()
      
      Returns a BPatch_function representing the function in which this point
      is contained.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_basicBlockLoop *getLoop()
      
      Returns the containing BPatch_basicBlockLoop if this point is part of
      loop instrumentation. Returns NULL otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void *getAddress()
      
      Return the address of the first instruction at this point.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool usesTrap_NP()
      
      Return true if inserting instrumentation at this point requires using a
      trap. On the x86 architecture, because instructions are of variable
      size, the instruction at a point may be too small for Dyninst to replace
      it with the normal code sequence used to call instrumentation. Also,
      when instrumentation is placed at points other than subroutine entry,
      exit, or call points, traps may be used to ensure the instrumentation
      fits. In this case, Dyninst replaces the instruction with a single-byte
      instruction that generates a trap. A trap handler then calls the
      appropriate instrumentation code. Since this technique is used only on
      some platforms, on other platforms this function always returns false.
      
   .. cpp:function:: const BPatch_memoryAccess* getMemoryAccess()
      
      Returns the memory access object associated with this point. Memory
      access points are described in section 4.27.1.
      
   .. cpp:function:: const std::vector<BPatchSnippetHandle *> getCurrentSnippets()
      
   .. cpp:function:: const std::vector<BPatchSnippetHandle *> getCurrentSnippets(BPatch_callWhen when)
      
      Return the BPatchSnippetHandles for the BPatch_snippets that are
      associated with the point. If argument when is BPatch_callBefore, then
      BPatchSnippetHandles for snippets installed immediately before this
      point will be returned. Alternatively, if when is BPatch_callAfter, then
      BPatchSnippetHandles for snippets installed immediately after this point
      will be returned.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getLiveRegisters(std::vector<BPatch_register> &regs)
      
      Fill regs with the registers that are live before this point (e.g.,
      BPatch_callBefore). Currently returns only general purpose registers
      (GPRs).
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isDynamic()
      
      This call returns true if this is a dynamic call site (e.g. a call site
      where the function call is made via a function pointer).
      
   .. cpp:function:: void* monitorCalls(BPatch_function* func)
      
      For a dynamic call site, this call instruments the call site represented
      by this instrumentation point with a function call. If input parameter
      func is not NULL, func is called at the call site as the
      instrumentation. If func is NULL, the callback function registered with
      BPatch::registerDynamicCallCallback is used for instrumentation. Under
      both cases, this call returns a pointer to the called function. If the
      instrumentation point does not represent a dynamic call site, this call
      returns NULL.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool stopMonitoring()
      
      This call returns true if this instrumentation point is a dynamic call
      site and its instrumentation is successfully removed. Otherwise, it
      returns false.
      
   .. cpp:function:: Dyninst::InstructionAPI::Instruction::Ptr getInstructionAtPoint()
      
      On implemented platforms, this function returns a shared pointer to an
      InstructionAPI Instruction object representing the first machine
      instruction at this pointâ€™s address. On unimplemented platforms, returns
      a NULL shared pointer.
      
``BPatch_image``
----------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_image

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_image
   
   This class defines a program image (the executable associated with a
   process). The only way to get a handle to a BPatch_image is via the
   BPatch_process member function getImage.
   
   .. cpp:function:: const BPatch_point *createInstPointAtAddr (caddr_t address)
      
      This function has been removed because it is not safe to use. Instead,
      use findPoints:
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool findPoints(Dyninst::Address addr, std::vector<BPatch_point *> &points);
      
      Returns a vector of BPatch_points that correspond with the provided
      address, one per function that includes an instruction at that address.
      There will be one element if there is not overlapping code.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_variableExpr *> *getGlobalVariables()
      
      Return a vector of global variables that are defined in this image.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_process *getProcess()
      
      Returns the BPatch_process associated with this image.
      
   .. cpp:function:: char *getProgramFileName(char *name, unsigned int len)
      
      Fills provided buffer name with the programâ€™s file name up to len
      characters. The filename may include path information.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getSourceObj(std::vector<BPatch_sourceObj *> &sources)
      
      Fill sources with the source objects (see section 4.6) that belong to
      this image. If there are no source objects, the function returns false.
      Otherwise, it returns true.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_function *> *getProcedures(bool incUninstrumentable = false)
      
      Return a vector of the functions in the image. If the
      incUninstrumentable flag is set, the returned table of procedures will
      include uninstrumentable functions. The default behavior is to omit
      these functions.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getObjects(std::vector<BPatch_object *> &objs)
      
      Fill in a vector of objects in the image.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_module *> *getModules()
      
      Return a vector of the modules in the image.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getVariables(std::vector<BPatch_variableExpr *> &vars)
      
      Fills vars with the global variables defined in this image. If there are
      no variable, the function returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_function*> *findFunction( \
         const char *name, \
         std::vector<BPatch_function*> &funcs, \
         bool showError = true, \
         bool regex_case_sensitive = true, \
         bool incUninstrumentable = false)
      
      Return a vector of BPatch_functions corresponding to name, or NULL if
      the function does not exist. If name contains a POSIX-extended regular
      expression, and dont_use_regex is false, a regular expression search
      will be performed on function names and matching BPatch_functions
      returned. If showError is true, then Dyninst will report an error via
      the BPatch::registerErrorCallback if no function is found.
      
      If the incUninstrumentable flag is set, the returned table of procedures
      will include uninstrumentable functions. The default behavior is to omit
      these functions.
      
      .. note::
      
         If name is not found to match any demangled function names in
         the module, the search is repeated as if name is a mangled function
         name. If this second search succeeds, functions with mangled names
         matching name are returned instead.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_function*> *findFunction( \
         std::vector<BPatch_function*> &funcs, \
         BPatchFunctionNameSieve bpsieve,\ 
         void *sieve_data = NULL,\ 
         int showError = 0,\ 
         bool incUninstrumentable = false)
      
      Return a vector of BPatch_functions according to the generalized
      user-specified filter function bpsieve. This permits users to easily
      build sets of functions according to their own specific criteria.
      Internally, for each BPatch_function f in the image, this method makes a
      call to bpsieve(f.getName(), sieve_data). The user-specified function
      bpsieve is responsible for taking the name argument and determining if
      it belongs in the output vector, possibly by using extra user-provided
      information stored in sieve_data. If the name argument matches the
      desired criteria, bpsieve should return true. If it does not, bpsieve
      should return false.
      
      The function bpsieve should be defined in accordance with the typedef:
      
   .. cpp:type:: bool (*BPatchFunctionNameSieve) (const char *name, void* sieve_data);
      
      If the incUninstrumentable flag is set, the returned table of procedures
      will include uninstrumentable functions. The default behavior is to omit
      these functions.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool findFunction(Dyninst::Address addr, std::vector<BPatch_function *>&funcs)
      
      Find all functions that have code at the given address, addr. Dyninst
      supports functions that share code, so this method may return more than
      one BPatch_function. These functions are returned via the funcs output
      parameter. This function returns true if it finds any functions, false
      otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_variableExpr *findVariable(const char *name, bool showError = true)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_variableExpr *findVariable(BPatch_point &scope, const char *name)
      
      second form of this method is not implemented on Windows.
      
      Performs a lookup and returns a handle to the named variable. The first
      form of the function looks up only variables of global scope, and the
      second form uses the passed BPatch_point as the scope of the variable.
      The returned BPatch_variableExpr can be used to create references (uses)
      of the variable in subsequent snippets. The scoping rules used will be
      those of the source language. If the image was not compiled with
      debugging symbols, this function will fail even if the variable is
      defined in the passed scope.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_type *findType(const char *name)
      
      Performs a lookup and returns a handle to the named type. The handle can
      be used as an argument to BPatch_addressSpace::malloc to create new
      variables of the corresponding type.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_module *findModule(const char *name, bool substring_match = false)
      
      Returns a module named name if present in the image. If the match fails,
      NULL is returned. If substring_match is true, the first module that has
      name as a substring of its name is returned (e.g. to find
      libpthread.so.1, search for libpthread with substring_match set to
      true).
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getSourceLines(unsigned long addr, std::vector<BPatch_statement> & lines)
      
      Given an address addr, this function returns a vector of pairs of
      filenames and line numbers at that address. This function is an alias
      for BPatch_Â­process::getSourceLines (see section 4.4).
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getAddressRanges( const char * fileName, unsigned int lineNo, \
         std::vector< std::pair< unsigned long, unsigned long > > & ranges )
      
      Given a file name and line number, fileName and lineNo, this function
      returns a list of address ranges that this source line was compiled
      into. This function is an alias for BPatch_process::getAddressRanges
      (see section 4.4).
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool parseNewFunctions(std::vector<BPatch_module*> &newModules, \
            const std::vector<Dyninst::Address> &funcEntryAddrs)
      
      This function takes as input a list of function entry points indicated
      by the funcEntryAddrs vector, which are used to seed parsing in whatever
      modules they are found. All affected modules are placed in the
      newModules vector, which includes any existing modules in which new
      functions are found, as well as modules corresponding to new regions of
      the binary, for which new BPatch_modules are created. The return value
      is true in the event that at least one previously unknown function was
      identified, or false otherwise.
      
``BPatch_object``
-----------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_object

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_object
   
   An object of this class represents the original executable or a library.
   It serves as a container of BPatch_module objects.
   
   .. cpp:function:: std::string name()
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::string pathName()
      
      Return the name of this file; either just the file name or the fully
      path-qualified name.
      
   .. cpp:function:: Dyninst::Address fileOffsetToAddr(Dyninst::Offset offset)
      
      Convert the provided offset into the file into a full address in memory.
      
   .. cpp:struct:: Region
      
   .. cpp:enum:: @typet
   
      .. cpp:enumerator:: UNKNOWN

      .. cpp:member:: Dyninst::Address base 
   
      .. cpp:member:: unsigned long size
   
      .. cpp:member:: type_t type
      
   .. cpp:function:: void regions(std::vector<Region> &regions)
      
      Returns information about the address ranges occupied by this object in
      memory.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void modules(std::vector<BPatch_module *> &modules)
      
      Returns the modules contained in this object.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_function*> *findFunction( \
         const char *name,\ 
         std::vector<BPatch_function*> &funcs,\
         bool dont_use_regex, \
         bool showError = true,\
         bool regex_case_sensitive = true,\
         bool incUninstrumentable = false)
      
      Return a vector of BPatch_functions corresponding to name, or NULL if
      the function does not exist. If name contains a POSIX-extended regular
      expression, and dont_use_regex is false, a regular expression search
      will be performed on function names and matching BPatch_functions
      returned. If showError is true, then Dyninst will report an error via
      the BPatch::registerErrorCallback if no function is found.
      
      If the incUninstrumentable flag is set, the returned table of procedures
      will include uninstrumentable functions. The default behavior is to omit
      these functions.
      
      .. note::
      
         If name is not found to match any demangled function names in
         the module, the search is repeated as if name is a mangled function
         name. If this second search succeeds, functions with mangled names
         matching name are returned instead.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool findPoints(Dyninst::Address addr, std::vector<BPatch_point *> &points);
      
      Return a vector of BPatch_points that correspond with the provided
      address, one per function that includes an instruction at that address.
      There will be one element if there is not overlapping code.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_function*> *findFunction( \
         const char *name, \
         std::vector<BPatch_function*> &funcs, \
         bool notify_on_failure = true, \
         bool regex_case_sensitive = true, \
         bool incUninstrumentable = false)
      
      Return a vector of BPatch_functions matching name, or NULL if the
      function does not exist. If name contains a POSIX-extended regular
      expression, a regex search will be performed on function names, and
      matching BPatch_functions returned. [**NOTE**: The std::vector argument
      funcs must be declared fully by the user before calling this function.
      Passing in an uninitialized reference will result in undefined
      behavior.]
      
      If the incUninstrumentable flag is set, the returned table of procedures
      will include uninstrumentable functions. The default behavior is to omit
      these functions.
      
      .. note::
         If name is not found to match any demangled function names in
         the BPatch_object, the search is repeated as if name is a mangled
         function name. If this second search succeeds, functions with mangled
         names matching name are returned instead.
      
``BPatch_module``
-----------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_module

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_module
   
   An object of this class represents a program module, which is part of a
   programâ€™s executable image. A BPatch_module represents a source file in
   either an executable or a shared library. Dyninst automatically creates
   a module called DEFAULT_MODULE in each executable to hold any objects
   that it cannot match to a source file. BPatch_module objects are
   obtained by calling the BPatch_image member function getModules.
   
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_function*> *findFunction( \
         const char *name, \
         std::vector<BPatch_function*> &funcs, \
         bool notify_on_failure = true, \
         bool regex_case_sensitive = true, \
         bool incUninstrumentable = false)
      
      Return a vector of BPatch_functions matching name, or NULL if the
      function does not exist. If name contains a POSIX-extended regular
      expression, a regex search will be performed on function names, and
      matching BPatch_functions returned. [**NOTE**: The std::vector argument

      Passing in an uninitialized reference will result in undefined
      behavior.]
      
      If the incUninstrumentable flag is set, the returned table of procedures
      will include uninstrumentable functions. The default behavior is to omit
      these functions.
      
      [**NOTE**: If name is not found to match any demangled function names in
      the module, the search is repeated as if name is a mangled function
      name. If this second search succeeds, functions with mangled names
      matching name are returned instead.]
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_Vector<BPatch_function *> *findFunctionByAddress( \

         bool notify_on_failure = true, \
         bool incUninstrumentable = false)
      
      Return a vector of BPatch_functions that contains addr, or NULL if the
      function does not exist. [**NOTE**: The std::vector argument funcs must
      be declared fully by the user before calling this function. Passing in
      an uninitialized reference will result in undefined behavior.]
      
      If the incUninstrumentable flag is set, the returned table of procedures
      will include uninstrumentable functions. The default behavior is to omit
      these functions.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_function *findFunctionByEntry(Dyninst::Address addr)
      
      Returns the function that begins at the specified address addr.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_function *findFunctionByMangled( \
         const char *mangled_name, \
         bool incUninstrumentable = false)
      
      Return a BPatch_function for the mangled function name defined in the
      module corresponding to the invoking BPatch_module, or NULL if it does
      not define the function.
      
      If the incUninstrumentable flag is set, the functions searched will
      include uninstrumentable functions. The default behavior is to omit
      these functions.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getAddressRanges( char * fileName, unsigned int lineNo, \
         std::vector< std::pair< unsigned long, unsigned long > > & ranges )
      
      Given a filename and line number, fileName and lineNo, this function
      this function returns the ranges of mutatee addresses that implement the
      code range in the output parameter ranges. In many cases a source code
      line will only have one address range implementing it. However, compiler
      optimizations may turn this into multiple, disjoint address ranges. This
      information is only available if the mutatee was compiled with debug
      information.
      
      This function may be more efficient than the BPatch_process version of
      this function. Calling BPatch_process::getAddressRange will cause
      Dyninst to parse line information for all modules in a process. If
      BPatch_module::getAddressRange is called then only the debug information
      in this module will be parsed.
      
      This function returns true if it was able to find any line information,
      false otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: size_t getAddressWidth()
      
      Return the size (in bytes) of a pointer in this module. On 32-bit
      systems this function will return 4, and on 64-bit systems this function
      will return 8.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void *getBaseAddr()
      
      Return the base address of the module. This address is defined as the
      start of the first function in the module.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_function *>* getProcedures( bool incUninstrumentable = false )
      
      Return a vector containing the functions in the module.
      
   .. cpp:function:: char *getFullName(char *buffer, int length)
      
      Fills buffer with the full path name of a module, up to length
      characters when this information is available.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_hybridMode getHybridMode()
      
      Return the mutatorâ€™s analysis mode for the mutate; the default mode is
      the normal mode.
      
   .. cpp:function:: char *getName(char *buffer, int len)
      
      This function copies the filename of the module into buffer, up to len
      characters. It returns the value of the buffer parameter.
      
   .. cpp:function:: unsigned long getSize()
      
      Return the size of the module. The size is defined as the end of the
      last function minus the start of the first function.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getSourceLines( unsigned long addr, std::vector<BPatch_statement> &lines )
      
      This function returns the line information associated with the mutatee
      address addr. The vector lines contain pairs of filenames and line
      numbers that are associated with addr. In many cases only one filename
      and line number is associated with an address, but certain compiler
      optimizations may lead to multiple filenames and lines at an address.
      This information is only available if the mutatee was compiled with
      debug information.
      
      This function may be more efficient than the BPatch_process version of
      this function. Calling BPatch_process::getSourceLines will cause Dyninst
      to parse line information for all modules in a process. If
      BPatch_module::getSourceLines is called then only the debug information
      in this module will be parsed.
      
      This function returns true if it was able to find any line information
      at addr, or false otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: char *getUniqueString(char *buffer, int length)
      
      Performs a lookup and returns a unique string for this image. Returns a
      string the can be compared (via strcmp) to indicate if two images refer
      to the same underlying object file (i.e., executable or library). The
      contents of the string are implementation specific and defined to have
      no semantic meaning.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getVariables(std::vector<BPatch_variableExpr *> &vars)
      
      Fill the vector vars with the global variables that are specified in
      this module. Returns false if no results are found and true otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BpatchSnippetHandle* insertInitCallback(Bpatch_snippet& callback)
      
      This function inserts the snippet callback at the entry point of this
      moduleâ€™s init function (creating a new init function/section if
      necessary).
      
   .. cpp:function:: BpatchSnippetHandle* insertFiniCallback(Bpatch_snippet& callback)
      
      This function inserts the snippet callback at the exit point of this
      moduleâ€™s fini function (creating a new fini function/section if
      necessary).
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isExploratoryModeOn()
      
      This function returns true if the mutatorâ€™s analysis mode sets to the
      defensive mode or the exploratory mode.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isMutatee()
      
      This function returns true if the module is the mutatee.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isSharedLib()
      
      This function returns true if the module is part of a shared library.
      
``BPatch_snippet``
------------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_snippet

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_snippet
   
   A snippet is an abstract representation of code to insert into a
   program. Snippets are defined by creating a new instance of the correct
   subclass of a snippet. For example, to create a snippet to call a
   function, create a new instance of the class BPatch_funcCallExpr.
   Creating a snippet does not result in code being inserted into an
   application. Code is generated when a request is made to insert a
   snippet at a specific point in a program. Sub-snippets may be shared by
   different snippets (i.e, a handle to a snippet may be passed as an
   argument to create two different snippets), but whether the generated
   code is shared (or replicated) between two snippets is implementation
   dependent.
   
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_type *getType()
      
      Return the type of the snippet. The BPatch_type system is described in
      section 4.14.
      
   .. cpp:function:: float getCost()
      
      Returns an estimate of the number of seconds it would take to execute
      the snippet. The problems with accurately estimating the cost of
      executing code are numerous and out of the scope of this document[2]. It
      is important to realize that the returned cost value is, at best, an
      estimate.
      
      The rest of the classes are derived classes of the class BPatch_snippet.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_actualAddressExpr()
      
      This snippet results in an expression that evaluates to the actual
      address of the instrumentation. To access the original address where
      instrumentation was inserted, use BPatch_originalAddressExpr. Note that
      this actual address is highly dependent on a number of internal
      variables and has no relation to the original address.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_arithExpr(BPatch_binOp op, const BPatch_snippet &lOperand, const BPatch_snippet &rOperand)
      
      Perform the required binary operation. The available binary operators
      are:
      
      +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
      | **Operator**  | **Description**                                  |
      +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
      | BPatch_assign | assign the value of rOperand to lOperand         |
      +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
      | BPatch_plus   | add lOperand and rOperand                        |
      +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
      | BPatch_minus  | subtract rOperand from lOperand                  |
      +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
      | BPatch_divide | divide rOperand by lOperand                      |
      +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
      | BPatch_times  | multiply rOperand by lOperand                    |
      +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
      | BPatch_ref    | Array reference of the form lOperand[rOperand]   |
      +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
      | BPatch_seq    | Define a sequence of two expressions (similar to |
      |               | comma in C)                                      |
      +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
      
      BPatch_arithExpr(BPatch_unOp, const BPatch_snippet &operand)
      
      Define a snippet consisting of a unary operator. The unary operators
      are:
      
      ============= ==========================================
      **Operator**  **Description**
      BPatch_negate Returns the negation of an integer
      BPatch_addr   Returns a pointer to a BPatch_variableExpr
      BPatch_deref  Dereferences a pointer
      ============= ==========================================
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_boolExpr(BPatch_relOp op, const BPatch_snippet &lOperand, const BPatch_snippet &rOperand)
      
      Define a relational snippet. The available operators are:
      
      ============ ==========================================
      **Operator** **Function**
      BPatch_lt    Return lOperand < rOperand
      BPatch_eq    Return lOperand == rOperand
      BPatch_gt    Return lOperand > rOperand
      BPatch_le    Return lOperand <= rOperand
      BPatch_ne    Return lOperand != rOperand
      BPatch_ge    Return lOperand >= rOperand
      BPatch_and   Return lOperand && rOperand (Boolean and)
      BPatch_or    Return lOperand \|\| rOperand (Boolean or)
      ============ ==========================================
      
      The type of the returned snippet is boolean, and the operands are type
      checked.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_breakPointExpr()
      
      Define a snippet that stops a process when executed by it. The stop can
      be detected using the isStopped member function of BPatch_process, and
      the programâ€™s execution can be resumed by calling the continueExecution
      member function of BPatch_process.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_bytesAccessedExpr()
      
      This expression returns the number of bytes accessed by a memory
      operation. For most load/store architecture machines it is a constant
      expression returning the number of bytes for the particular style of
      load or store. This snippet is only valid at a memory operation
      instrumentation point.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_constExpr(signed int value)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_constExpr(unsigned int value)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_constExpr(signed long value)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_constExpr(unsigned long value)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_constExpr(const char *value)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_constExpr(const void *value)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_constExpr(long long value)
      
      Define a constant snippet of the appropriate type. The char* form of
      the constructor creates a constant string; the null-terminated string
      beginning at the location pointed to by the parameter is copied into the
      applicationâ€™s address space, and the BPatch_constExpr that is created
      refers to the location to which the string was copied.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_dynamicTargetExpr()
      
      This snippet calculates the target of a control flow instruction with a
      dynamically determined target. It can handle dynamic calls, jumps, and
      return statements.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_effectiveAddressExpr()
      
      Define an expression that contains the effective address of a memory
      operation. For a multi-word memory operation (i.e. more than the
      "natural" operation size of the machine), the effective address is the
      base address of the operation.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_funcCallExpr(const BPatch_function& func, const std::vector<BPatch_snippet*> &args)
      
      Define a call to a function. The passed function must be valid for the
      current code region. Args is a list of arguments to pass to the
      function; the maximum number of arguments varies by platform and is
      summarized below. If type checking is enabled, the types of the passed
      arguments are checked against the function to be called. Availability of
      type checking depends on the source language of the application and
      program being compiled for debugging.
      
      ============ ===============================
      **Platform** **Maximum number of arguments**
      AMD64/EMT-64 No limit
      IA-32        No limit
      POWER        8 arguments
      ============ ===============================
      
      BPatch_funcJumpExpr (const BPatch_function &func)
      
      This snippet has been removed; use BPatch_addressSpace::wrapFunction
      instead.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_ifExpr(const BPatch_boolExpr &conditional, const BPatch_snippet &tClause, const BPatch_snippet &fClause)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_ifExpr(const BPatch_boolExpr &conditional, const BPatch_snippet &tClause)
      
      This constructor creates an if statement. The first argument,
      conditional, should be a Boolean expression that will be evaluated to
      decide which clause should be executed. The second argument, tClause, is
      the snippet to execute if the conditional evaluates to true. The third
      argument, fClause, is the snippet to execute if the conditional
      evaluates to false. This third argument is optional. Else-if statements,
      can be constructed by making the fClause of an if statement another if
      statement.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_insnExpr(BPatch_instruction *insn)
      
      implemented on x86-64
      
      This constructor creates a snippet that allows the user to mimic the
      effect of an existing instruction. In effect, the snippet "wraps" the
      instruction and provides a handle to particular components of
      instruction behavior. This is currently implemented for memory
      operations, and provides two override methods: overrideLoadAddress and
      overrideStoreAddress. Both methods take a BPatch_snippet as an argument.
      Unlike other snippets, this snippet should be installed via a call to
      BPatch_processÂ­::replaceCode (to replace the original instruction). For
      example:
      
      .. code-block:: cpp
      
         // Assume that access is of type BPatch_memoryAccess, as
         // provided by a call to BPatch_point->getMemoryAccess. A
         // BPatch_memoryAccess is a child of BPatch_instruction, and
         // is a valid source of a BPatch_insnExpr.
         BPatch_insnExpr insn(access);
      
         // This example will modify a store by increasing the target
         // address by 16.
         BPatch_arithExpr newStoreAddr(BPatch_plus,
         BPatch_effectiveAddressExpr(),
         BPatch_constExpr(16));
      
         // now override the original store address
         insn.overrideStoreAddress(newStoreAddr)
      
         // now replace the original instruction with the new one.
         // Point is a BPatch_point corresponding to the desired location, and
         // process is a BPatch_process.
         process.replaceCode(point, insn);
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_nullExpr()
      
      Define a null snippet. This snippet contains no executable statements.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_originalAddressExpr()
      
      This snippet results in an expression that evaluates to the original
      address of the point where the snippet was inserted. To access the
      actual address where instrumentation is executed, use
      BPatch_actualAddressExpr.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_paramExpr(int paramNum)
      
      This constructor creates an expression whose value is a parameter being
      passed to a function. ParamNum specifies the number of the parameter to
      return, starting at 0. Since the contents of parameters may change
      during subroutine execution, this snippet type is only valid at points
      that are entries to subroutines, or when inserted at a call point with
      the when parameter set to BPatch_callBefore.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_registerExpr(BPatch_register reg)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_registerExpr(Dyninst::MachRegister reg)
      
      This snippet results in an expression whose value is the value in the
      register at the point of instrumentation.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_retExpr()
      
      This snippet results in an expression that evaluates to the return value
      of a subroutine. This snippet type is only valid at BPatch_exit points,
      or at a call point with the when parameter set to BPatch_callAfter.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_scrambleRegistersExpr()
      
      This snippet sets all General Purpose Registers to the flag value.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_sequence(const std::vector<BPatch_snippet*> &items)
      
      Define a sequence of snippets. The passed snippets will be executed in
      the order in which they appear in items.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_shadowExpr(bool entry, \
         const BPatchStopThreadCallback &cb, \
         const BPatch_snippet &calculation, \
         bool useCache = false, \
         BPatch_stInterpret interp = BPatch_noInterp)
      
      This snippet creates a shadow copy of the snippet BPatch_stopThreadExpr.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_stopThreadExpr(const BPatchStopThreadCallback &cb, \
         const BPatch_snippet &calculation, \
         bool useCache = false, \
         BPatch_stInterpret interp = BPatch_noInterp)
      
      This snippet stops the thread that executes it. It evaluates a
      calculation snippet and triggers a callback to the user program with the
      result of the calculation and a pointer to the BPatch_point at which the
      snippet was inserted.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_threadIndexExpr()
      
      This snippet returns an integer expression that contains the thread
      index of the thread that is executing this snippet. The thread index is
      the same value that is returned on the mutator side by
      BPatch_thread::getBPatchID.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_tidExpr(BPatch_process *proc)
      
      This snippet results in an integer expression that contains the tid of
      the thread that is **executing** this snippet. This can be used to
      record the threadId, or to filter instrumentation so that it only
      executes for a specific thread.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_variableExpr(char *in_name, \
         BPatch_addressSpace *in_addSpace, \
         AddressSpace *as, \
         AstNodePtr ast_wrapper_, \
         BPatch_type *type, void* in_address)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_variableExpr(BPatch_addressSpace *in_addSpace, \
         AddressSpace *as,\
         void *in_address,\
         int in_register,\
         BPatch_type *type,\
         BPatch_storageClass storage = BPatch_storageAddr, \
         BPatch_point *scp = NULL)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_variableExpr(BPatch_addressSpace *in_addSpace, \
         AddressSpace *as, \
         BPatch_localVar *lv, \
         BPatch_type *type, \
         BPatch_point *scp)
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_variableExpr(BPatch_addressSpace *in_addSpace, \
         AddressSpace *ll_addSpace, \
         int_variable *iv, \
         BPatch_type *type)
      
      Define a variable snippet of the appropriate type. The first constructor
      is used to get function pointers; the second is used to get forked
      copies of variable expression, used by malloc; the third is used for
      local variables; and the last is used by
      BPatch_addressSpace::findOrCreateVariable().
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_whileExpr(const BPatch_snippet &condition, const BPatch_snippet &body)
      
      This constructor creates a while statement. The first argument,
      condition, should be a Boolean expression that will be evaluated to
      decide whether body should be executed. The second argument, body, is
      the snippet to execute if the condition evaluates to true.
      
``BPatch_type``
---------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_type

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_type
   
   The class BPatch_type is used to describe the types of variables,
   parameters, return values, and functions. Instances of the class can
   represent language predefined types (e.g. int, float), mutatee defined
   types (e.g., structures compiled into the mutatee application), or
   mutator defined types (created using the create* methods of the BPatch
   class).
   
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_field *> *getComponents()
      
      Return a vector of the types of the fields in a BPatch_struct or
      BPatch_union. If this method is invoked on a type whose BPatch_dataClass
      is not BPatch_struct or BPatch_union, NULL is returned.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_cblock *> *getCblocks()
      
      Return the common block classes for the type. The methods of the
      BPatch_cblock can be used to access information about the member of a
      common block. Since the same named (or anonymous) common block can be
      defined with different members in different functions, a given common
      block may have multiple definitions. The vector returned by this
      function contains one instance of BPatch_cblock for each unique
      definition of the common block. If this method is invoked on a type
      whose BPatch_dataClass is not BPatch_common, NULL will be returned.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_type *getConstituentType()
      
      Return the type of the base type. For a BPatch_array this is the type of
      each element, for a BPatch_pointer this is the type of the object the
      pointer points to. For BPatch_typedef types, this is the original type.
      For all other types, NULL is returned.
      
   .. cpp:enum:: BPatch_dataClass
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_dataClass::BPatch_dataScalar
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_dataClass::BPatch_dataEnumerated
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_dataClass::BPatch_dataTypeClass

   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_dataClass::BPatch_dataNullType
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_dataClass getDataClass()
      
      Return one of the above data classes for this type.
      
   .. cpp:function:: unsigned long getLow()
      
   .. cpp:function:: unsigned long getHigh()
      
      Return the upper and lower bound of an array. Calling these two methods
      on non-array types produces an undefined result.
      
   .. cpp:function:: const char *getName()
      
      Return the name of the type.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isCompatible(const BPatch_type &otype)
      
      Return true if otype is type compatible with this type. The rules for
      type compatibility are given in Section 4.28. If the two types are not
      type compatible, the error reporting callback function will be invoked
      one or more times with additional information about why the types are
      not compatible.
      
``BPatch_variableExpr``
-----------------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_variableExpr

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_variableExpr
   
   The **BPatch_variableExpr** class is another class derived from
   BPatch_snippet. It represents a variable or area of memory in a
   processâ€™s address space. A BPatch_variableExpr can be obtained from a
   BPatch_process using the malloc member function, or from a BPatch_image
   using the findVariable member function.
   
   Some BPatch_variableExpr have an associated BPatch_type, which can be
   accessed by functions inherited from BPatch_snippet. BPatch_variableExpr
   objects will have an associated BPatch_type if they originate from
   binaries with sufficient debug information that describes types, or if
   they were provided with a BPatch_type when created by Dyninst.
   
   **BPatch_variableExpr** provides several member functions not provided
   by other types of snippets:
   
   .. cpp:function:: void readValue(void *dst)
      
   .. cpp:function:: void readValue(void *dst, int size)
      
      Read the value of the variable in an applicationâ€™s address space that is
      represented by this BPatch_variableExpr. The dst parameter is assumed to
      point to a buffer large enough to hold a value of the variableâ€™s type.
      If the size parameter is supplied, then the number of bytes it specifies
      will be read. For the first version of this method, if the size of the
      variable is unknown (i.e., no type information), no data is copied and
      the method returns false.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void writeValue(void *src)
      
   .. cpp:function:: void writeValue(void *src, int size)
      
      Change the value of the variable in an applicationâ€™s address space that
      is represented by this BPatch_variableExpr. The src parameter should
      point to a value of the variableâ€™s type. If the size parameter is
      supplied, then the number of bytes it specifies will be written. For the
      first version of this method, if the size of the variable is unknown
      (i.e., no type information), no data is copied and the method returns
      false.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void *getBaseAddr()
      
      Return the base address of the variable. This is designed to let users
      who wish to access elements of arrays or fields in structures do so. It
      can also be used to obtain the address of a variable to pass a point to
      that variable as a parameter to a procedure call. It is similar to the
      ampersand (&) operator in C.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_variableExpr *> *getComponents()
      
      Return a pointer to a vector containing the components of a struct or
      union. Each element of the vector is one field of the composite type,
      and contains a variable expression for accessing it.
      
``BPatch_flowGraph``
--------------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_flowGraph

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_flowGraph
   
   The **BPatch_flowGraph** class represents the control flow graph of a
   function. It provides methods for discovering the basic blocks and loops
   within the function (using which a caller can navigate the graph). A
   BPatch_flowGraph object can be obtained by calling the getCFG method of
   a BPatch_function object.
   
   .. cpp:function:: bool containsDynamicCallsites()
      
      Return true if the control flow graph contains any dynamic call sites
      (e.g., calls through a function pointer).
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getAllBasicBlocks(std::set<BPatch_basicBlock*>&)
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getAllBasicBlocks(BPatch_Set<BPatch_basicBlock*>&)
      
      Fill the given set with pointers to all basic blocks in the control flow
      graph. BPatch_basicBlock is described in section 4.17.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getEntryBasicBlock(std::vector<BPatch_basicBlock*>&)
      
      Fill the given vector with pointers to all basic blocks that are entry
      points to the function. BPatch_basicBlock is described in section 4.17.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getExitBasicBlock(std::vector<BPatch_basicBlock*>&)
      
      Fill the given vector with pointers to all basic blocks that are exit
      points of the function. BPatch_basicBlock is described in section 4.17.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getLoops(std::vector<BPatch_basicBlockLoop*>&)
      
      Fill the given vector with a list of all natural (single entry) loops in
      the control flow graph.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getOuterLoops(std::vector<BPatch_basicBlockLoop*>&)
      
      Fill the given vector with a list of all natural (single entry) outer
      loops in the control flow graph.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_loopTreeNode *getLoopTree()
      
      Return the root node of the tree of loops in this flow graph.
      
   .. cpp:enum:: BPatch_procedureLocation
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_procedureLocation::BPatch_locLoopEntry
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_procedureLocation::BPatch_locLoopExit
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_procedureLocation::BPatch_locLoopStartIter
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_procedureLocation::BPatch_locLoopEndIter
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_point*> *findLoopInstPoints( \
         const BPatch_procedureLocation loc, BPatch_basicBlockLoop *loop);
      
      Find instrumentation points for the given loop that correspond to the
      given location: loop entry, loop exit, the start of a loop iteration and
      the end of a loop iteration. BPatch_locLoopEntry and BPatch_locLoopExit
      instrumentation points respectively execute once before the first
      iteration of a loop and after the last iteration.
      BPatch_locLoopStartIter and BPatch_locLoopEndIter respectively execute
      at the beginning and end of each loop iteration.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_basicBlock* findBlockByAddr(Dyninst::Address addr);
      
      Find the basic block within this flow graph that contains addr. Returns
      NULL on failure. This method is inefficient but guaranteed to succeed if
      addr is present in any block in this CFG.
      
      .. note::
         Dyninst is not always able to generate a correct flow graph
         in the presence of indirect jumps. If a function has a case statement or
         indirect jump instructions, the targets of the jumps are found by
         searching instruction patterns (peep-hole). The instruction patterns
         generated are compiler specific and the control flow graph analyses
         include only the ones we have seen. During the control flow graph
         generation, if a pattern that is not handled is used for case statement
         or multi-jump instructions in the function address space, the generated
         control flow graph may not be complete.
      
``BPatch_basicBlock``
---------------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_basicBlock

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_basicBlock
   
   The **BPatch_basicBlock** class represents a basic block in the
   application being instrumented. Objects of this class representing the
   blocks within a function can be obtained using the BPatch_flowGraph
   object for the function. BPatch_basicBlock includes methods for
   navigating through the control flow graph of the containing function.
   
   .. cpp:function:: void getSources(std::vector<BPatch_basicBlock*>&)
      
      Fills the given vector with the list of predecessors for this basic

      graph leading to this block).
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getTargets(std::vector<BPatch_basicBlock*>&)
      
      Fills the given vector with the list of successors for this basic block
      (i.e, basic blocks that are the destinations of outgoing edges from this
      block in the control flow graph).
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getOutgoingEdges(std::vector<BPatch_edge *> &out)
      
      Fill out with all of the control flow edges that leave this basic block.

   .. cpp:function:: bool getInstructions(std::vector <std::pair<Dyninst::InstructionAPI::Instruction,Address> >&)
      
      Fills the given vector with InstructionAPI Instruction objects
      representing the instructions in this basic block, and returns true if
      successful. See the InstructionAPI Programmerâ€™s Guide for details. The
      second call also returns the address each instruction starts at.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool dominates(BPatch_basicBlock*)
      
      This function returns true if the argument is pre-dominated in the
      control flow graph by this block, and false if it is not.

      this basic blockâ€™s instruction sequence.
      
   .. cpp:function:: int getBlockNumber()

      from 0 to *n-1,* where *n* is the number of basic blocks in the flow
      graph to which this basic block belongs.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_point *> findPoint(const std::set<BPatch_opCode>&ops)
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_point *> findPoint(const BPatch_Set<BPatch_opCode>&ops)
      
      Find all points in the basic block that match the given operation.

      function.
      
   .. cpp:function:: unsigned size()
      
      Return the size of a basic block. The size is defined as the difference
      between the end address and the start address of the basic block.
      
``BPatch_edge``
---------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_edge

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_edge
   
   The **BPatch_edge** class represents a control flow edge in a
   BPatch_flowGraph.
   
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_point *getPoint()
      
      Return an instrumentation point for this edge. This point can be passed
      to BPatch_process::insertSnippet to instrument the edge.
      
   .. cpp:enum:: BPatch_edgeType
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_edgeType::CondJumpTaken
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_edgeType::CondJumpNottaken
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_edgeType::UncondJump
   .. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_edgeType::NonJump
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_edgeType getType()
      
      Return a type describing this edge. A CondJumpTaken edge is found after
      a conditional branch, along the edge that is taken when the condition is
      true. A CondJumpNottaken edge follows the path when the condition is not
      taken. UncondJump is used along an edge that flows out of an
      unconditional branch that is always taken. NonJump is an edge that flows
      out of a basic block that does not end in a jump, but falls through into
      the next basic block.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_basicBlock *getSource()
      
      Return the source BPatch_basicBlock that this edge flows from.

``BPatch_basicBlockLoop``
-------------------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_basicBlockLoop

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_basicBlockLoop
   
   An object of this class represents a loop in the code of the application
   being instrumented. We detect both natural loops (single-entry loops)
   and irreducible loops (multi-entry loops). For a natural loop, it has
   only one entry block and this entry block dominates all blocks in the
   loop; thus the entry block is also called the head or the header of the
   loop. However, for an irreducible loop, it has multiple entry blocks and
   none of them dominates all blocks in the loop; thus there is no head or
   header for an irreducible loop. The following figure illustrates the
   difference:
   
   Figure (a) above shows a natural loop, where block 1 represents the
   single entry and block 1 is the head of the loop. Block 1 dominates
   block 2 and block 3. Figure (b) above shows an irreducible loop, where
   block 1 and block 2 are the entries of the loop. Neither block 1 nor
   block 2 domiantes block 3.
   
   .. cpp:function:: bool containsAddress(unsigned long addr)
      
      Return true if addr is contained within any of the basic blocks that
      compose this loop, excluding the block of any of its sub-loops.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool containsAddressInclusive(unsigned long addr)
      
      Return true if addr is contained within any of the basic blocks that
      compose this loop, or in the blocks of any of its sub-loops.
      
   .. cpp:function:: int getBackEdges(std::vector<BPatch_edge *> &edges)
      
      Returns the number of back edges in this loop and adds those edges to
      the edges vector. An edge is a back edge if it is from a block in the
      loop to an entry block of the loop.
      
   .. cpp:function:: int getLoopEntries(std::vector<BPatch_basicBlock *> &entries)
      
      Returns the number of entry blocks of this loop and adds those blocks to
      the entries vector. An irreducible loop can have multiple entry blocks.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getContainedLoops(std::vector<BPatch_basicBlockLoop*>&)
      
      Fill the given vector with a list of the loops nested within this loop.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_flowGraph *getFlowGraph()
      
      Return a pointer to the control flow graph that contains this loop.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getOuterLoops(std::vector<BPatch_basicBlockLoop*>&)
      
      Fill the given vector with a list of the outer loops nested within this
      loop.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getLoopBasicBlocks(std::vector<BPatch_basicBlock*>&)
      
      Fill the given vector with a list of all basic blocks that are part of
      this loop.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getLoopBasicBlocksExclusive(std::vector<BPatch_basicBlock*>&)
      
      Fill the given vector with a list of all basic blocks that are part of
      this loop but not its sub-loops.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool hasAncestor(BPatch_basicBlockLoop*)
      
      Return true if this loop is nested within the given loop (the given loop
      is one of its ancestors in the tree of loops).
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool hasBlock(BPatch_basicBlock *b)
      
      Return true if this loop or any of its sub-loops contain b, false
      otherwise.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool hasBlockExclusive(BPatch_basicBlock *b)
      
      Return true if this loop, excluding its sub-loops, contains b, false
      otherwise.
      
``BPatch_loopTreeNode``
-----------------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_loopTreeNode

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_loopTreeNode
   
   The **BPatch_loopTreeNode** class provides a tree interface to a
   collection of instances of class BPatch_basicBlockLoop contained in a
   BPatch_flowGraph. The structure of the tree follows the nesting
   relationship of the loops in a functionâ€™s flow graph. Each
   BPatch_Â­loopTreeNode contains a pointer to a loop (represented by
   BPatch_basicBlockLoop), and a set of sub-loops (represented by other
   BPatch_loopTreeNode objects). The root BPatch_Â­loopTreeNode instance has
   a null loop member since a function may contain multiple outer loops.
   The outer loops are contained in the root instanceâ€™s vector of children.
   
   Each instance of BPatch_loopTreeNode is given a name that indicates its
   position in the hierarchy of loops. The name of each root loop takes the
   form of loop_x, where x is an integer from 1 to n, where n is the number
   of outer loops in the function. Each sub-loop has the name of its
   parent, followed by a .y, where y is 1 to m, where m is the number of
   sub-loops under the outer loop. For example, consider the following C
   function:
   
   .. code-block:: cpp
   
      void foo() {
         int x, y, z, i;
         
         for (x=0; x<10; x++) {
            for (y = 0; y<10; y++)
            ...
            for (z = 0; z<10; z++)
            ...
         }
         for (i = 0; i<10; i++) {
         ...
         }
      }
   
   The foo function will have a root BPatch_loopTreeNode, containing a NULL
   loop entry and two BPatch_loopTreeNode children representing the
   functions outer loops. These children would have names loop_1 and
   loop_2, respectively representing the x and i loops. loop_2 has no
   children. loop_1 has two child BPatch_loopTreeNode objects, named
   loop_1.1 and loop_1.2, respectively representing the y and z loops.
   
   .. cpp:var:: BPatch_basicBlockLoop *loop
   
   A node in the tree that represents a single BPatch_basicBlockLoop
   instance.
   
   .. cpp:var:: std::vector<BPatch_loopTreeNode *> children
   
   The tree nodes for the loops nested under this loop.
   
   .. cpp:function:: const char *name()
      
      Return a name for this loop that indicates its position in the hierarchy
      of loops.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool getCallees(std::vector<BPatch_function *> &v, BPatch_addressSpace*p)
      
      This function fills the vector v with the list of functions that are
      called by this loop.
      
   .. cpp:function:: const char *getCalleeName(unsigned int i)
      
      This function return the name of the i\ :sup:`th` function called in the
      loopâ€™s body.
      
   .. cpp:function:: unsigned int numCallees()
      
      Returns the number of callees contained in this loopâ€™s body.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_basicBlockLoop *findLoop(const char *name)
      
      Finds the loop object for the given canonical loop name.
      
``BPatch_register``
-------------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_register

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_register
   
   A **BPatch_register** represents a single register of the mutatee. The
   list of BPatch_registers can be retrieved with the
   BPatch_addressSpace::getRegisters method.
   
   .. cpp:function:: std::string name()
      
      This function returns the canonical name of the register.
      
``BPatch_sourceBlock``
----------------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_sourceBlock

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_sourceBlock
   
   An object of this class represents a source code level block. Each
   source block objects consists of a source file and a set of source lines
   in that source file. This class is used to fill source line information
   for each basic block in the control flow graph. For each basic block in
   the control flow graph there is one or more source block object(s) that
   correspond to the source files and their lines contributing to the
   instruction sequence of the basic block.
   
   .. cpp:function:: const char* getSourceFile()
      
      Returns a pointer to the name of the source file in which this source
      block occurs.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void getSourceLines(std::vector<unsigned short>&)
      
      Fill the given vector with a list of the lines contained within this
      source block.
      
``BPatch_cblock``
-----------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_cblock

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_cblock
   
   This class is used to access information about a common block.
   
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_field *> *getComponents()
      
      Return a vector containing the individual variables of the common block.
      
   .. cpp:function:: std::vector<BPatch_function *> *getFunctions()
      
      Return a vector of the functions that can see this common block with the
      set of fields described in getComponents. However, other functions that
      define this common block with a different set of variables (or sizes of
      any variable) will not be returned.
      
``BPatch_frame``
----------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_frame

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_frame
   
   A **BPatch_frame** object represents a stack frame. The getCallStack
   member function of BPatch_thread returns a vector of BPatch_frame
   objects representing the frames currently on the stack.
   
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_frameType getFrameType()
      
      Return the type of the stack frame. Possible types are:
      
      +------------------------+------------------------------------+
      | **Frame Type**         | **Meaning**                        |
      +------------------------+------------------------------------+
      | BPatch_frameNormal     | A normal stack frame.              |
      +------------------------+------------------------------------+
      | BPatch_frameSignal     | A frame that represents a signal   |
      |                        | invocation.                        |
      +------------------------+------------------------------------+
      | BPatch_frameTrampoline | A frame the represents a call into |
      |                        | instrumentation code.              |
      +------------------------+------------------------------------+
      
   .. cpp:function:: void *getFP()
      
      Return the frame pointer for the stack frame.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void *getPC()
      
      Returns the program counter associated with the stack frame.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_function *findFunction()
      
      Returns the function associated with the stack frame.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_thread *getThread()
      
      Returns the thread associated with the stack frame.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_point *getPoint()
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_point *findPoint()
      
      For stack frames corresponding to inserted instrumentation, returns the
      instrumentation point where that instrumentation was inserted. For other
      frames, returns NULL.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isSynthesized()
      
      Returns true if this frame was artificially created, false otherwise.
      
``StackMod``
------------
.. cpp:namespace:: StackMod

.. cpp:class:: StackMod
   
   This class defines modifications to the stack frame layout of a
   function. Stack modifications are basd on the abstraction of stack
   locations, not the contents of these locations. All stack offsets are
   with respect to the original stack frame, even if
   BPatch_fuction::addMods is called multiple times for a single function.
   
   implemented on x86 and x86-64
   
   Insert(int low, int high)
   
   | This constructor creates a stack modification that inserts stack space
     in the range
   | [low, high), where low and high are stack offsets.
   
   BPatch_function::addMods will find this modification unsafe if any
   instructions in the function access memory that will be non-contiguous
   after [low,high) is inserted.
   
   Remove(int low, int high)
   
   | This constructor creates a stack modification that removes stack space
     in the range
   | [low, high), where low and high are stack offsets.
   
   BPatch_function::addMods will find this modification unsafe if any
   instructions in the function access stack memory in [low,high).
   
   Move(int sLow, int sHigh, int dLow)
   
   This constructor creates a stack modification that moves stack space
   [sLow, sHigh) to [dLow, dLow+(sHigh-sLow)).
   
   | BPatch_function::addMods will find this modification unsafe if
   | Insert(dLow, dLow+(sHigh-sLow)) or Remove(sLow, sHigh) are unsafe.
   
   Canary()implemented on Linux, GCC only
   
   Canary(BPatch_function* failFunc) implemented on Linux, GCC only
   
   This constructor creates a stack modification that inserts a stack
   canary at function entry and a corresponding canary check at function
   exit(s).
   
   This uses the same canary as GCCâ€™s â€“fstack-protector. If the canary
   check at function exit fails, failFunc is called. failFunc must be
   non-returning and take no arguments. If no failFunc is provided,
   \__stack_chk_fail from libc is called; libc must be open in the
   corresponding BPatch_addressSpace.
   
   This modification will have no effect on functions in which the entry
   and exit point(s) are the same.
   
   BPatch_function::addMods will find this modification unsafe if another
   Canary has already been added to the function. Note, however, that this
   modification can be applied to code compiled with â€“fstack-protector.
   
   Randomize()
   
   Randomize(int seed)
   
   This constructor creates a stack modification that rearranges the
   stack-stored local variables of a function. This modification requires
   symbol information (e.g., DWARF), and only local variables specified by
   the symbols will be randomized. If DyninstAPI finds a stack access that
   is not consistent with a symbol-specified local, that local will not be
   randomized. Contiguous ranges of local variables are randomized; if
   there are two or more contiguous ranges of locals within the stack
   frame, each is randomized separately. More than one local variable is
   required for randomization.
   
   BPatch_function::addMods will return false if Randomize is added to a
   function without local variable information, without local variables on
   the stack, or with only a single local variable.
   
   srand is used to generate a new ordering of local variables; if seed is
   provided, this value is provided to srand as its seed.
   
   BPatch_function::addMods will find this modification unsafe if any other
   modifications have been applied.
   
   26. .. rubric:: Container Classes
          :name: container-classes
   
       1. .. rubric:: Class std::vector
             :name: class-stdvector
   
   The **std::vector** class is a container used to hold other objects used
   by the API. As of Dyninst 5.0, std::vector is an alias for the C++
   Standard Template Library (STL) std::vector.
   
``BPatch_Set``
--------------
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_Set

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_Set
   
   **BPatch_Set** is another container class, similar to the set class in
   the STL. THIS CLASS HAS BEEN DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED IN THE NEXT
   RELEASE. In addition the methods provided by std::set, it provides the
   following compatibility methods:
   
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_Set::BPatch_Set()
      
      A constructor that creates an empty set with the default comparison
      function.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_Set::BPatch_Set(const BPatch_Set<T,Compare>& newBPatch_Set)
      
      Copy constructor.
      
   .. cpp:function:: void remove(const T&)
      
      Remove the given element from the set.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool contains(const T&)
      
      Return true if the argument is a member of the set, otherwise returns
      false.
      
   .. cpp:function:: T* elements(T*)
      
   .. cpp:function:: void elements(std::vector<T> &)
      
      Fill an array (or vector) with a list of the elements in the set that
      are sorted in ascending order according to the comparison function. The
      input argument should point to an array large enough to hold the
      elements. This function returns its input argument, unless the set is
      empty, in which case it returns NULL.
      
   .. cpp:function:: T minimum()
      
      Return the minimum element in the set, as determined by the comparison
      function. For an empty set, the result is undefined.
      
   .. cpp:function:: T maximum()
      
      Return the maximum element in the set, as determined by the comparison
      function. For an empty set, the result is undefined.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_Set<T,Compare>& operator+= (const T&)
      
      Add the given object to the set.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_Set<T,Compare>& operator|= (const BPatch_Set<T,Compare>&)
      
      Set union operator. Assign the result of the union to the set on the
      left hand side.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_Set<T,Compare>& operator&= (const BPatch_Set<T,Compare>&)
      
      Set intersection operator. Assign the result of the intersection to the
      set on the left hand side.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_Set<T,Compare>& operator-= (const BPatch_Set<T,Compare>&)
      
      Set difference operator. Assign the difference of the sets to the set on
      the left hand side.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_Set<T,Compare> operator| (const BPatch_Set<T,Compare>&)
      
      Set union operator.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_Set<T,Compare> operator& (const BPatch_Set<T,Compare>&)
      
      Set intersection operator.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_Set<T,Compare> operator- (const BPatch_Set<T,Compare>&)
      
      Set difference operator.
      
Memory Access
-------------

Instrumentation points created through findPoint(const
std::set<BPatch_opCode>& ops) get memory access information attached to
them. This information is used by the memory access snippets, but is
also available to the API user. The classes that encapsulate memory
access information are contained in the BPatch_memoryAccess_NP.h header.
      
``BPatch_memoryAccess``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_memoryAccess

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_memoryAccess
   
   This class encapsulates a memory access abstraction. It contains
   information that describes the memory access type: read, write,
   read/write, or prefetch. It also contains information that allows the
   effective address and the number of bytes transferred to be determined.
   
   .. cpp:function:: bool isALoad()
      
      Return true if the memory access is a load (memory is read into a
      register).
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isAStore()
      
      Return true if the memory access is write. Some machine instructions may
      both load and store.
      
   .. cpp:function:: bool isAPrefetch_NP()
      
      Return true if memory access is a prefetch (i.e, it has no observable
      effect on user registers). It this returns true, the instruction is
      considered neither load nor store. Prefetches are detected only on IA32.
      
   .. cpp:function:: short prefetchType_NP()
      
      If the memory access is a prefetch, this method returns a platform
      specific prefetch type.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_addrSpec_NP getStartAddr_NP()
      
      Return an address specification that allows the effective address of a
      memory reference to be computed. For example, on the x86 platform a
      memory access instruction operand may contain a base register, an index
      register, a scaling value, and a constant base. The BPatch_addrSpec_NP
      describes each of these values.
      
   .. cpp:function:: BPatch_countSpec_NP getByteCount_NP()
      
      Return a specification that describes the number of bytes transferred by
      the memory access.
      
``BPatch_addrSpec_NP``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_addrSpec_NP

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_addrSpec_NP
   
   This class encapsulates the information required to determine an
   effective address at runtime. The general representation for an address
   is a sum of two registers and a constant; this may change in future
   releases. Some architectures use only certain bits of a register (e.g.
   bits 25:31 of XER register on the Power chip family); these are
   represented as pseudo-registers. The numbering scheme for registers and
   pseudo-registers is implementation dependent and should not be relied
   upon; it may change in future releases.
   
   .. cpp:function:: int getImm()
      
      Return the constant offset. This may be positive or negative.
      
   .. cpp:function:: int getReg(unsigned i)
      
      Return the register number for the i\ :sup:`th` register in the sum,
      where 0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ 2. Register numbers are positive; a value of -1 means no
      register.
      
   .. cpp:function:: int getScale()
      
      Returns any scaling factor used in the memory address computation.
      
``BPatch_countSpec_NP``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. cpp:namespace:: BPatch_countSpec_NP

.. cpp:class:: BPatch_countSpec_NP
   
   This class encapsulates the information required to determine the number
   of bytes transferred by a memory access.
   
Type System
-----------

The Dyninst type system is based on the notion of structural
equivalence. Structural equivalence was selected to allow the system the
greatest flexibility in allowing users to write mutators that work with
applications compiled both with and without debugging symbols enabled.
Using the create* methods of the BPatch class, a mutator can construct
type definitions for existing mutatee structures. This information
allows a mutator to read and write complex types even if the application
program has been compiled without debugging information. However, if the
application has been compiled with debugging information, Dyninst will
verify the type compatibility of the operations performed by the
mutator.

The rules for type computability are that two types must be of the same
storage class (i.e. arrays are only compatible with other arrays) to be
type compatible. For each storage class, the following additional
requirements must be met for two types to be compatible:
   
Bpatch_dataScalar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. cpp:class:: Bpatch_dataScalar
   
   Scalars are compatible if their names are the same (as defined by
   strcmp) and their sizes are the same.
   
BPatch_dataPointer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. cpp:class:: BPatch_dataPointer
   
   Pointers are compatible if the types they point to are compatible.
   
BPatch_dataFunc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. cpp:class:: BPatch_dataFunc
   
   Functions are compatible if their return types are compatible, they have
   same number of parameters, and position by position each element of the
   parameter list is type compatible.
   
BPatch_dataArray
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. cpp:class:: BPatch_dataArray
   
   Arrays are compatible if they have the same number of elements
   (regardless of their lower and upper bounds) and the base element types
   are type compatible.
   
BPatch_dataEnumerated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. cpp:class:: BPatch_dataEnumerated
   
   Enumerated types are compatible if they have the same number of elements
   and the identifiers of the elements are the same.
   
BPatch_dataUnion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. cpp:class:: BPatch_dataUnion
   
   Structures and unions are compatible if they have the same number of
   constituent parts (fields) and item by item each field is type
   compatible with the corresponds field of the other type.
   
   In addition, if either of the types is the type BPatch_unknownType, then
   the two types are compatible. Variables in mutatee programs that have
   not been compiled with debugging symbols (or in the symbols are in a
   format that the Dyninst library does not recognize) will be of type
   BPatch_unknownType.
   
Callbacks
---------
   
   The following functions are intended as a way for API users to be
   informed when an error or significant event occurs. Each function allows
   a user to register a handler for an event. The return code for all
   callback registration functions is the address of the handler that was
   previously registered (which may be NULL if no handler was previously
   registered). For backwards compatibility reasons, some callbacks may
   pass a BPatch_thread object when a BPatch_process may be more
   appropriate. A BPatch_thread may be converted into a BPatch_process
   using BPatch_thread::getProcess().
   
Asynchronous Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. cpp:type:: void (*BPatchAsyncThreadEventCallback)(BPatch_process *proc, BPatch_thread *thread)
   
.. cpp:function:: bool registerThreadEventCallback(BPatch_asyncEventType type, BPatchAsyncThreadEventCallback cb)
   
.. cpp:function:: bool removeThreadEventCallback(BPatch_asyncEventType type, BPatch_AsyncThreadEventCallback cb)
   
   The type parameter can be either one of BPatch_threadCreateEvent or
   BPatch_threadDestroyEvent. Different callbacks can be registered for
   different values of type.
   
Code Discovery Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
.. cpp:type:: void (*BPatchCodeDiscoveryCallback)( \
      BPatch_Vector<BPatch_function*> &newFuncs, \
      BPatch_Vector<BPatch_function*> &modFuncs)
   
.. cpp:function:: bool registerCodeDiscoveryCallback(BPatchCodeDiscoveryCallback cb)
   
.. cpp:function:: bool removeCodeDiscoveryCallback(BPatchCodeDiscoveryCallback cb)
   
   This callback is invoked whenever previously un-analyzed code is
   discovered through runtime analysis, and delivers a vector of functions
   whose analysis have been modified and a vector of functions that are
   newly discovered.
   
Code Overwrite Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
.. cpp:type:: void (*BPatchCodeOverwriteBeginCallback)(BPatch_Vector<BPatch_basicBlock*> &overwriteLoopBlocks);
   
.. cpp:type void (*BPatchCodeOverwriteEndCallback)( \
      BPatch_Vector<std::pair<Dyninst::Address,int> > &deadBlocks, \
      BPatch_Vector<BPatch_function*> &owFuncs, \
      BPatch_Vector<BPatch_function*> &modFuncs, \
      BPatch_Vector<BPatch_function*> &newFuncs)
   
.. cpp:function:: bool registerCodeOverwriteCallbacks( \
      BPatchCodeOverwriteBeginCallback cbBegin, \
      BPatchCodeOverwriteEndCallback cbEnd)
   
   Register a callback at the beginning and end of overwrite events. Only
   invoke if Dyninst's hybrid analysis mode is set to BPatch_defensiveMode.
   
   The BPatchCodeOverwriteBeginCallback callback allows the user to remove
   any instrumentation when the program starts writing to a code page,
   which may be desirable as instrumentation cannot be removed during the
   overwrite loop's execution, and any breakpoint instrumentation will
   dramatically slow the loop's execution.
   
   The BPatchCodeOverwriteEndCallback callback delivers the effects of the
   overwrite loop when it is done executing. In many cases no code will
   have changed.
   
Dynamic calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
.. cpp:type:: void (*BPatchDynamicCallSiteCallback)( \
         BPatch_point *at_point, BPatch_function *called_function);
   
.. cpp:function:: bool registerDynamicCallCallback(BPatchDynamicCallSiteCallback cb);
   
.. cpp:function:: bool removeDynamicCallCallback(BPatchDynamicCallSiteCallback cb);
   
   The registerDynamicCallCallback interface will not automatically
   instrument any dynamic call site. To make sure the call back function is
   called, the user needs to explicitly instrument dynamic call sites. One
   way to achieve this goal is to first get instrumentation points
   representing dynamic call sites and then call BPatch_point::monitorCalls
   with a NULL input parameter.
   
Dynamic libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
.. cpp:type::  void (*BPatchDynLibraryCallback)(BPatch_thread *thr, \
         BPatch_object *obj, bool loaded);
   
.. cpp:function:: BPatchDynLibraryCallback registerDynLibraryCallback(BPatchDynLibraryCallback func)
   
   Note that in versions previous to 9.1, BPatchDynLibraryCallbackâ€™s
   signature took a BPatch_module instead of a BPatch_object.
   
Errors
~~~~~~
   
.. cpp:enum:: BPatchErrorLevel
.. cpp:enumerator:: BPatchErrorLevel::BPatchFatal
.. cpp:enumerator:: BPatchErrorLevel::BPatchSerious
.. cpp:enumerator:: BPatchErrorLevel::BPatchWarning
.. cpp:enumerator:: BPatchErrorLevel::BPatchInfo
   
.. cpp:type:: void (*BPatchErrorCallback)(BPatchErrorLevel severity, int \
         number, const char * const *params)
   
.. cpp:function:: BPatchErrorCallback registerErrorCallback(BPatchErrorCallback func)
   
   This function registers the error callback function with the BPatch
   class. The return value is the address of the previous error callback
   function. Dyninst users can change the error callback during program
   execution (e.g., one error callback before a GUI is initialized, and a
   different one after). The severity field indicates how important the
   error is (from fatal to information/status). The number is a unique
   number that identifies this error message. Params are the parameters
   that describe the detail about an error, e.g., the process id where the
   error occurred. The number and meaning of params depends on the error.
   However, for a given error number the number of parameters returned will
   always be the same.
   
Exec
~~~~
   
.. cpp:type:: void (*BPatchExecCallback)(BPatch_thread *thr)
   
.. cpp:function:: BPatchExecCallback registerExecCallback(BPatchExecCallback func)
   
   .. warning::
      Not implemented on Windows.
      
Exit
~~~~

.. cpp:enum:: BPatch_exitType
.. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_exitType::NoExit
.. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_exitType::ExitedNormally
.. cpp:enumerator:: BPatch_exitType::ExitedViaSignal
   
.. cpp:type:: void (*BPatchExitCallback)(BPatch_thread *proc, BPatch_exitType exit_type);
   
.. cpp:function:: BPatchExitCallback registerExitCallback(BPatchExitCallback func)
   
   Register a function to be called when a process terminates. For a normal
   process exit, the callback will actually be called just before the
   process exits, but while its process state still exists. This allows
   final actions to be taken on the process before it actually exits. The
   function BPatch_thread::isTerminated() will return true in this context
   even though the process hasnâ€™t yet actually exited. In the case of an
   exit due to a signal, the process will have already exited.
   
Fork
~~~~
   
.. cpp:type:: void (*BPatchForkCallback)(BPatch_thread *parent, BPatch_thread* child);
   
   This is the prototype for the pre-fork and post-fork callbacks. The
   parent parameter is the parent thread, and the child parameter is a
   BPatch_thread in the newly created process. When invoked as a pre-fork
   callback, the child is NULL.
   
.. cpp:function:: BPatchForkCallback registerPreForkCallback(BPatchForkCallback func)
   
   .. warning::
      not implemented on Windows
   
.. cpp:function:: BPatchForkCallback registerPostForkCallback(BPatchForkCallback func)
   
   .. warning::
      not implemented on Windows
   
   Register callbacks for pre-fork (before the child is created) and
   post-fork (immediately after the child is created). When a pre-fork
   callback is executed the child parameter will be NULL.
   
One Time Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
.. cpp:type:: void (*BPatchOneTimeCodeCallback)(Bpatch_thread *thr, void *userData, void *returnValue)
   
.. cpp:function:: BPatchOneTimeCodeCallback registerOneTimeCodeCallback(BPatchOneTimeCodeCallback func)
   
   The thr field contains the thread that executed the oneTimeCode (if
   thread-specific) or an unspecified thread in the process (if
   process-wide). The userData field contains the value passed to the
   oneTimeCode call. The returnValue field contains the return result of
   the oneTimeCode snippet.
   
Signal Handler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
.. cpp:type:: void (*BPatchSignalHandlerCallback)(BPatch_point *at_point, \
         long signum, std::vector<Dyninst::Address> *handlers)
   
.. cpp:function:: bool registerSignalHandlerCallback(BPatchSignalHandlerCallback cb, std::set<long> &signal_numbers)
   
.. cpp:function:: bool registerSignalHandlerCallback(BPatchSignalHandlerCallback cb, \
         BPatch_Set<long> *signal_numbers)
   
.. cpp:function:: bool removeSignalHandlerCallback(BPatchSignalHandlerCallback cb);
   
   This function registers the signal handler callback function with the
   BPatch class. The return value indicates success or failure. The
   signal_numbers set contains those signal numbers for which the callback
   will be invoked.
   
   The at_point parameter indicates the point at which the signal/exception
   was raised, signum is the number of the signal/exception that was
   raised, and the handlers vector contains any registered handler(s) for
   the signal/exception. In Windows this corresponds to the stack of
   Structured Exception Handlers, while for Unix systems there will be at
   most one registered exception handler. This functionality is only fully
   implemented for the Windows platform.
   
Stopped Threads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
.. cpp:type:: void (*BPatchStopThreadCallback)(BPatch_point *at_point, void *returnValue)
   
   This is the prototype for the callback that is associated with the
   stopThreadExpr snippet class (see Section 4.13). Unlike the other
   callbacks in this section, stopThreadExpr callbacks are registered
   during the creation of the stopThreadExpr snippet type. Whenever a
   stopThreadExpr snippet executes in a given thread, the snippet evaluates
   the calculation snippet that stopThreadExpr takes as a parameter, stops
   the threadâ€™s execution and invokes this callback. The at_point parameter
   is the BPatch_point at which the stopThreadExpr snippet was inserted,
   and returnValue contains the computation made by the calculation
   snippet.
   
User-triggered callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
.. cpp:type:: void (*BPatchUserEventCallback)(BPatch_process *proc, void *buf, unsigned int bufsize);
   
.. cpp:function:: bool registerUserEventCallback(BPatchUserEventCallback cb)
   
.. cpp:function:: bool removeUserEventCallback(BPatchUserEventCallback cb)
   
   Register a callback that is executed when the user sends a message from
   the mutatee using the DYNINSTuserMessage function in the runtime
   library.
